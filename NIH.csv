"8693991","Methamphetamine (MA) is remarkably addictive and relapse to excessive use is highly probable and poses serious health concerns. Genetic factors have been little studied with regard to their role in susceptibility to MA addiction or relapse. A key goal will be to utilize a validated animal model of genetically-determined high and low susceptibility to MA use to improve genetic mapping resolution and to study an already identified neuroimmune gene network that influences MA response in this genetic model. In Aim 1, in coordination with Animal Core 3, replicated sets of selected mouse lines bred for high and low voluntary consumption of MA will be produced and QTL mapping will be performed by the Biostatistics and Genetics Core 2. These mice will be used for studies proposed in Components 7, 8 and 9. In Aim 2, neurocircuitry will be examined in the selected lines, using cFos mapping after acute and repeated MA treatment, and these data will be used to identify brain regions for immune factor analysis, and will be compared to imaging results from Scientific Component 7 for brains from the MA consumption selected lines. In Aim 3, qPCR immunology arrays will be used to examine brain and peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression for immune specific genes using samples from selectively bred MA drinking line mice that have been acutely or repeatedly treated with MA or with saline, or are in ""remission"". These data will be used in additional network analysis by the Biostatistics and Genetics Core 2 and compared to human peripheral gene expression results for controls, chronic MA users and user in remission. In Aim 4, cognitive, anxiety-like, and impulsivity-like traits will be examined in drug naive, acute, and repeated MA-exposed MADR mice, as well as mice in remission from MA exposure. Tissue from mice treated in the same way will be transferred to Translational Service Core 5 for analysis of immune factors and to Component 7 for imaging;half of each brain will be sent for each purpose to allow individual animal correlations to be performed. These data will also be examined for correspondence between behavior, neurocircuitry and immune system alterations. In addition, impulsivity-like measures in mice will be compared to similar measures in humans from Component 7. Finally, data collected in Component 9 will inform Component 8, with regard to traits and which of the selected lines to be studied for immunotherapeutic intervention. Cross-species analyses across components will identify key immune factors associated with chronic MA exposure (and remission) and MA-induced neuropsychiatric impairments, with the goal of ultimately identifying novel immunotherapeutic interventions."
"8693362"," Project Summary Risk bimarkers have become increasingly important in clinical decision making, guiding patients and their clinicians in choosing the most appropriate course of therapy or surveillance after treatment. Constructing accurate and individualized prediction rules and conducting rigorous validation are critical to the cancer biomarker field. Prospective cohort studies are crucial for such evaluation as time to event carries more information about a marker's value on early detection and prognosis than a simple measure of disease status. But prospective biomarker evaluation is challenging. Until now there has been little guidance pro- vided for statistical design and analysis of these studies. We propose to extend our previously funded effort to address several new challenges in prospective marker evaluation. The proposal will emphasize three unique aspects in prospective biomarker evaluation. First, for many cancers disease outcome may be heterogeneous due to the biological nature of the disease or selection of treatments. Constructing and validating prognostic and treatment selection rules based on more specific prediction of the risk of develop- ing aggressive cancer as opposed to indolent cancer is of great clinical interest yet analytically challenging. In Aim 1 we will provide statistical tools for developing and validating risk markers in a population with an unknown mixture of indolent and aggressive cancers. We propose statistical methods that facilitate the development and evaluation of prognostic markers for risk stratification. Methods for deriving and evalu- ating individualized treatment rules in the presence of a mixture of indolent and aggressive cancers will be considered. Second, among patients diagnosed with cancer who chose to be on active surveillance, developing monitoring tools to make adaptive monitoring or intervention recommendations with longitudinal biomarkers may alleviate overtreatment without missing signs of progression. In Aim 2 we will consider flexible procedures to quantify the updated predictive accuracy of longitudinal markers. In addition, we will develop and evaluate decision rules on the basis of risk, incorporating both cross-sectional and longi- tudinal marker information. The ascertainment of marker information in a large cohort requires enormous resources. Cost-effective cohort sampling is therefore highly desirable. In Aim 3 we will develop procedures to improve the efficiency of estimating risk and accuracy parameters and rigorously evaluate and compare different choices of matching/stratification rules and identify optimal pairs of analyses and sampling strate- gies. We will also develop estimation procedures for evaluating longitudinal markers in two-phase studies. Applications in cancer biomarker development provide a context for our research. Data from the Early De- tection Research Network and from several large cohort studies will be analyzed. Programs and algorithms developed in this proposal will be made available to public."
"8607498","    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite enormous efforts, no effective vaccine is currently available against HIV/AIDS. This is largely due to the virus's ability to evade neutralizing antibodies. The trimeric HIV envelope glycoprotein gp160 (HIV Env), which is exposed to the host immune response on the surface of the virion, effectively conceals epitopes from antibodies while maintaining its ability to promote viral entry. The few exposed antibody-binding sites are structurally unstable and sustain substantial sequence variability. Consequently, few broadly neutralizing antibodies have been identified. Here we will develop single molecule Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) imaging to monitor the conformational landscape of individual native Env molecules on the surface of an HIV virus. We will apply new enzymatic methods to introduce organic fluorophores into HIV Env at positions that don't interfere with infectivity. The placement of two dyes within one Env molecule will allow the application of smFRET to report conformational changes of the unliganded HIV Env from various angles. Following the characterization of the unliganded HIV Env, we will determine how its conformation dynamics change in response to receptor and antibody binding. Our approach will identify critical conformational states of HIV Env that should be targeted for vaccine development, reveal the molecular mechanism underlying immune evasion, and understand the potency of existing neutralizing antibodies.

"8697008","    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This four-year K01 award application is to provide intensive multi-disciplinary training and career development guidance for Dr. Yu-Hsiang Hsieh, PhD, an Assistant Professor in Emergency Medicine at the Johns Hopkins University, leading to his becoming an independent investigator. Under the guidance of world renowned, NIH-funded, experienced mentors, Drs. Richard Rothman, Joshua Epstein, and David Holtgrave, Dr. Hsieh will gain a set of complementary inter-disciplinary skills which will allow him to pursue research with a focus on devising and evaluating public health interventions for infectious diseases seen in acute care settings. The applicant will receive mentoring in: public health aspects of emergency medicine;infectious disease computational mathematical modeling;and cost-effectiveness analysis. The rationale for the work, evaluation of HIV screening strategies, comes from the fact that HIV incidence has remained unchanged in the U.S. over the past decade, with one in five infected remaining unaware of their serostatus. One of the cornerstones recently advanced by the CDC for controlling the epidemic is widespread screening in emergency department (ED) settings. While, increasing numbers of EDs across the U.S. have developed strategies to adapt HIV testing into routine practice, there have been no efforts to systematically address how effective ED-based HIV testing has been (relative to no ED-based testing), or, which of several testing strategies is optimal with regard to identifying the largest number of unrecognized cases, and decreasing community HIV transmission. A relatively new and innovative method of computational modeling, agent-based modeling (ABM), offers a potential means for handling the complexity of temporal dynamics of HIV epidemiology and human behaviors associated with availability of ED-based HIV testing services, and represents a promising approach for overcoming many of the shortcoming of conventional study designs. The goal of this research project is to: 1) derive a computational model for measuring the impact of ED HIV testing programs on the HIV epidemic in Baltimore, Maryland, using ABM methods;2) validate the derived ABM model;and 3) assess relative cost- effectiveness of ED HIV testing programs based on findings from the validated ABM model. The results of this study will provide new insights regarding current approaches to ED-based HIV testing programs and provide important cost-effectiveness data to inform local and national HIV testing strategies. The K01 award will provide Dr. Hsieh an intensive and directed mentored research experience in two new disciplines for him - infectious disease computational mathematical modeling, particularly ABM, and cost-effectiveness analysis. He will also receive needed training in the responsible conduct of research as well as longitudinal career guidance from an experience team. Together these experiences will equip him with the essential training and mentorship necessary to become an outstanding interdisciplinary independent public health investigator, who will build a research program focused on the study of infectious diseases in emergent, and acute care venues.         PROJECT NARRATIVE: Emergency department-based HIV testing programs in the United States have identified thousands of previously undiagnosed HIV-infected individuals since 2006, when the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention began to aggressively promote testing in this non-traditional health care venue. The applicant will pursue a period of intensive multi-disciplinary training in infectious disease mathematical modeling - particularly agent based modeling, and cost-effectiveness analysis, applying these methods to study public health screening in acute care settings. The rich research environment of Johns Hopkins University coupled with the nationally recognized team of expert mentors will lead to independent investigator status, and a career dedicated to research in the development and evaluation of public health intervention strategies which address a wide array of infectious diseases'threats seen in emergency and other acute episodic care settings.

"8725943","Antigen presenting cells (APCs) are critical for the induction of graft-versus-host / leukemia responses  after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Therefore agents that target dendritic cells (DCs),  the most potent APCs, might have therapeutic potential in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Histone  deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are novel anti-tumor agents that appear to be well tolerated in human  clinical trials. However their immuno-modulatory effects have heretofore been largely unrecognized.  Preliminary data generated and published by us demonstrate that HDACi regulate experimental acute  GVHD, in part, through induction of the immuno-regulatory enzyme indoleamine 2, 3 dioxygenase (IDO)  in host DCs. These exciting pre-clinical data formed the rationale for the development of a proof in  principle clinical trial that will test the effects of HDACi, vorinostat, in prevention of acute GVHD.  Preliminary data also demonstrate that acetylation of non-histone protein, STAT-3, in DCs is critical for  the induction of IDO by the HDACi. The specificity of the approach and the precise molecular  mechanisms are not known. This proposal flows from our exciting published and unpublished  observations generated from murine models and primary healthy human cells. We will test the central  hypothesis that acetylation of non-histone protein, STAT-3, by HDACi is critical for suppression of DCs  and the negative regulation of experimental GVHD. The Specific Aims are:  1. To determine the specific HDAC enzyme critical for acetylation of STAT-3 and regulation of DC  function by the HDACi  2. To elucidate the critical role of STAT-3 in regulation of DCs and GVHD by HDACi  3. To analyze the cellular markers of HDAC inhibition after vorinostat (an HDACi) administration  following reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic BMT"
"8574224","    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is one of the most prevalent mental disorders, and is associated with significant mortality, morbidity, and economic costs. The Stony Brook Temperament Study is an ongoing longitudinal study that seeks to identify early behavioral precursors/risk factors for depression and understand the neurobiological and psychosocial processes through which these early manifestations develop into MDD. This information about risk pathways and processes should contribute to understanding when and how to intervene in order to prevent the disorder and limit its progression. The study initially assessed a large community sample of 3-year old children, followed them up at age 6, and is currently evaluating them in middle childhood (age 9). This competing renewal application seeks to extend the study into adolescence, the beginning of the peak risk period for onset of MDD. Specifically, the application proposes to map pathways from laboratory observations of low positive emotionality and high negative emotionality at age 3 to neural indices of emotional and social information processing, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation, and emerging depressive and anxiety symptoms in early- (age 12) and mid- (age 15) adolescence. In addition, it seeks to understand the role of pubertal development and life stress in influencing these trajectories, and to capture the early portion of the expected sure in first-onset MDD that begins at puberty and continues through early adulthood.

"8692071","    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will develop a new approach to treat an aggressive and deadly form of metastatic breast cancer known as meningeal metastases, or metastases to the lining covering the brain. We propose to investigate an effective, long lasting, and targeted therapy with oncolytic replication conditional herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) that will potentially have a large impact on the treatment of meningeal metastases by reducing toxicity, promoting effective treatment outcome, and most significantly -prolonging life expectancy.  Meningeal metastasis is a deadly complication of breast cancer affecting approximately 5% of patients. At present, there is no effective therapy for meningeal metastases, and the median survival of the treated patients is about 3 months. Published data suggest that the incidence of this disease increases, probably due to the longer survival of patients with systemic cancer. The need for new therapeutic interventions is urgent.  The replication conditional herpes simplex type-1 (HSV-1) has been genetically engineered to replicate preferentially in cancer cells utilizing their enhanced mitotic activity. As such replicaion in cancer cells will kill these cells while leaving the normal tissue unharmed. This novel treatment will be investigated in a mouse model of meningeal metastases that has been fully characterized with molecular imaging with MRI over successive time points. The potential therapeutic effect of HSV-1 oncolysis on meningeal metastases will be investigated with molecular imaging and in vitro tissue analyses sequentially over time. Virus replication in the meningeal metastases will be determined by molecular imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) using FHBG as the substrate for the thymidine kinase enzyme specific for the virus. The therapeutic effect of oncolytic HSV-1 on meningeal metastases will be determined by molecular imaging with Gd enhanced MRI. If a therapeutic effect is achieved, the impact on therapy and patient survival will be huge and will be of direct clinical significance.        "
"8644130","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular mechanisms underlying blood development and disorders are of great interest and importance from the perspective of understanding normal function and leukemias. Drosophila has long served as a genetic model for many developmental processes, but its usefulness as a hematopoietic model has only recently been appreciated. The mechanisms that maintain blood stem cells in Drosophila show remarkable conservation in strategy of development and function with mammalian systems. The proposed work intends to determine the molecular pathways that maintain stem cell homeostasis. Also proposed is the role of systemic signals and nutrient deprivation on myeloid cell development. These are developmentally and medically relevant problems for which model systems amenable to genetic screens are essential to develop. The proposal has four specific aims. In Aim 1, a homeostatic model by which blood precursors are maintained not only by a signal from a niche, but also from the cells that have started differentiating will be developed. In Aim 2, the involvement of the transcription factor STAT in the maintenance of stem cell fate in Drosophila will be investigated. In Aim 3, the role of extracellular matrix components that control the integrity of stem cells will be studied. In the final aim, signals arising from the brain that control blood stem cell maintenance in Drosophila will be investigated and their role in starvation induced stem cell loss studied.        "
"8702828","    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this grant application is to develop a clinical tool for real-time assessment of irradiated brain tissue during neurosurgical resection or stereotaxic biopsy in patients with brain tumor recurrence. Primary and many metastatic brain tumors recur after radiation therapy (RT). However, identifying cancer recurrence is complicated by the development of radiation necrosis. It is important to rapidly distinguish radiation-injury from recurrent cancer during interventional neurosurgical procedures. Radiation necrosis and cancer are managed very differently. To address this problem, we propose development of a label-free, non-ionizing tissue assessment technique, i.e. Multispectral Scanning -Time Resolved Fluorescence Spectroscopy (MS-TRFS), which facilitates rapid in vivo evaluation of the biochemical and functional characteristics of brain tissue. The proposed technique can multispectrally evaluate the fluorescent decay of multiple cellular metabolites (NAD(P)H and other fluorescent constituents such as proteins and lipids) and is well suited to assess the biochemical features associated with radiation necrosis, malignant, and normal tissue. In this R21 application, we will test the ability of MS-TRFS to detect brain alterations associated with radiation necrosis. Two specific aims will be addressed. The first aim is designed to (i) provide a systematic evaluation of time-resolved fluorescence features associated with tissue radiation necrosis and (ii) support the identification of biochemical components contributing to unique autofluorescence signatures that can act as diagnostic markers of radiation necrosis. The second aim is focused on a proof-of-concept study in human patients designed to demonstrate whether a clinically compatible MS-TRFS device can be used for rapid diagnosis of radiation necrosis in the brain. If MS-TRFS proves useful in reliably distinguishing radiation necrosis from other brain tissue types in these pre-clinical and clinical studies, we anticipate further development of a specialized clinical MS-TRFS-based tool to aid in brain tumor surgical resection in the presence of radiation necrosis or during brain tissue stereotaxic biopsy. This has the potential to improve the clinical management of radiation necrosis and overall patient outcome. In addition, the small fiber optic probe size required enables further development of MS-TRFS as a pre-clinical research tool that can play a role in the optimization of RT. We envision that a MS-TRFS probe introduced in a rodent model into a tumor region by neurointerventional technology could also be used to monitor RT dosimetry and local tissue response.        "
"8823186","2.1. SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE. Wide global variation in age standardized rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) of 1.2 to 45.0/100,000 largely reflect the impact of dietary and lifestyle factors in the etiology of the disease.''The influence of the environment on CRC is evidenced by the change in CRC rates among 1st- and 2nd-generation immigrants to that of the host country, regardless of genetic background. Dietary and other lifestyle effects on the gut microbiome have long been postulated to explain these population differences in CRC rates. With recent advances in sequencing technology, it is now clear that diet and lifestyle (e.g., smoking, obesity, physical activity) significantly influence the composition of the gut microflora[2] with findings from experimental models and humans providing solid evidence for link between gut microbiota and CRC.[3-6] These findings has revitalized interest in the contribution of gut microbiota to CRC with particular interest in how the gut microbiome disturbs normal tissue homeostasis to enhance susceptibility to CRC as prevention targets.[3-6]    A long-standing interest of the UACC group is the role of bile acids (BA) and CRC. BAs, particularly the secondary BAs, are strongly suspect in CRC etiology.[7-8] Secondary BAs are produced by intestinal bacteria to salvage BAs that escape transport in the distal ileum.[9] These excess BAs act as substrates for intestinal bacterial dependent deconjugation of the hydroxy groups at C-3, C-7 and C-12 and 7alpha/Beta-dehydroxylation.[9-10] These bacteria-dependent processes give rise to suspected carcinogens: deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA). Our preliminary data suggest that the composition of the gut flora influences the composition of fecal BAs;which we postulate influences individual risk of neoplasia in the colorectum.    In this proposal our primary hypothesis is that lifestyle, diet, and health status impact the functional component of the gut microbiome and that these factors collectively influence the colonic BA composition as a risk factor for CRC. Our secondary hypothesis is that the effect(s) of shared environmental factors on the functional component of the gut microbiome that leads to production of pro-tumorigenic fecal BAs is largely independent of race/ethnicity and reflects the sharing of environmental factors.    In our studies of colorectal adenoma (CRA) (i.e., the premalignant precursor for CRC), minority populations are grossly underrepresented. As such, a major limitation of our studies is our inability to generalize findings on CRC risk factors and intervention targets to populations relevant to Arizona including Native Americans (NA). For NAs, a major challenge is the relatively small size of the population. The low population density, relative to non-Hispanic White (NHW), is a major factor in their underrepresentation. One strategy to assess the relative importance of our findings from NHW to the NA community is to test whether relationships between diet and the gut microbiome on fecal BA composition observed in NHW are similar in NA;particularly any found to be strongly associated with the risk of CRC. As part of our planned efforts described in the specific aims below, we will also initiate and effort to test if relationships observed between BAs (pro or anti-tumorigenic) and the gut microbiota and CRA identified in Aims 1 and 2 in NHWs are also present in NA populations.    2.2. SCIENTIFIC AIMS  S.1 In cross-section (baseline only), determine the association between the gut microbiome and the fecal BA composition in 735 participants of a Phase III trial to prevent CRA, considering the effects of age, sex, diet, and other factors (e.g., smoking, obesity, race/ethnicity and diabetes).    S.2 Test if baseline gut microbiome composition is associated with development of CRA and whether any association between the gut microbiome and CRA is dependent on baseline fecal BA composition, considering the intervention with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA).    S.3 Characterize differences in the gut microbiome and BA compositions in rural and urban dwelling Navajo and relate the findings to those observed in the study of NHWs at risk of CRC. The training component of this aim is for mentee Dr Yellowhair [mentored by Dr Thompson] to lead an effort to describe the gut microbiome and BA composition and levels in Navajo, considering urbanization, age, sex, and lifestyle (diet and exercise).    2.3 IMPACT. Identification of the factors (BAs, gut microbiome) that mediate the role of the environment in CRC will allow us to better target and modify the physiological factors that underlie the elevated CRC risk that occurs with modern diet and lifestyle factors. Further, demonstration of shared physiological consequences across NHW and NA populations would vastly enhance our ability to extrapolate findings from one population to another."
"8946388","Mast cells play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of allergic inflammation. These reactions are generally initiated by antigen-dependent aggregation of the high affinity IgE receptor (Fc-epsilon-RI) expressed on the cell surface and subsequent release of pro-inflammatory mediators. Ligands for other receptors such as KIT and various GPCRs may serve to prime mast cells for, or act as co-activators of, antigen-mediated mast cell activation. The signaling pathways linking Fc-epsilon-RI aggregation to human mast cell activation and function and how other receptors modify these Fc-mediated signaling events are not well understood. Thus the primary focus of the research is the elucidation of signaling mechanisms associated with the activation of mast cells via the Fc-epsilon-RI and especially how the signaling pathways initiated by other receptors may integrate with those initiated by the Fc-epsilon-RI for synergistic mast cell activation and/or inhibition.  The ability of mast cells to impact disease states in vivo also depends on their growth and differentiation from their progenitor cells, migration of the mast cells to their resident tissues, and their survival at these sites. Therefore, the integrated receptor-mediated signaling events regulating these processes are also being examined.  Recent key observations have been made relating to the effect of IL-33 on human mast cell function, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and the MS4A2-containing gene locus.   These studies in part also resulted in identification of a novel mouse mast cell line which now has been reported and allows the study of normal and mutated KIT constructs. These cells originated from a bone marrow-derived mouse mast cell culture as a rapidly dividing mast cell sub-population. Over time, these cells lost KIT expression while continuing to express functional high affinity receptors for IgE. Retroviral transduction of the cells with a human KIT construct resulted in surface expression of human KIT which responded to human stem cell factor (SCF;KIT ligand).   In examining IL-33 on mast cell function, we discovered that long-term exposure of human and mouse mast cells to IL-33 results in a substantial reduction of mast cell activation in response to antigen.  This appears to be a consequence of MyD88-dependent attenuation of signaling processes necessary for mast cell activation including antigen-mediated calcium mobilization and cytoskeletal reorganization. These changes were related to down-regulation of the expression of PLCg1 and Hck.  Linkage analyses have implicated the MS4A2-containing gene locus (encoding for Fc-epsilon-RI) as a candidate for allergy susceptibility. We have identified a truncation of Fc-epsilon-RI (t-Fc-epsilon-RI) in humans which contains a putative calmodulin binding domain.  We thus sought to identify the role of this variant in mast cell function. We determined that t-Fc-epsilon-RI forms a complex with Fyn kinase, Gab2, p85 PI3K and -tubulin. Calmodulin bound to t-Fc-epsilon-RI in the presence of Ca2+ initiating phosphorylation, which was critical for t-Fc-epsilon-RI function. Confocal microscopy demonstrated localization of the t-Fc-epsilon-RI complex to the Golgi surrounding the centrosome after IgE-dependent and IgE-independent activation. Knockdown of t-Fc-epsilon-RI attenuated microtubule formation, degranulation and IL-8 production downstream of Ca2+ signals. These observations are consistent with the conclusion that t-Fc-epsilon-RI mediates Ca2+-dependent microtubule formation, which promotes degranulation and cytokine release.  Migration of mast cells to sites of inflammation is known to be regulated by chemotactic factors such as SCF. Despite inducing similar early signaling events to antigen, chemotactic factors (including SCF) produce minimal degranulation in the absence of other stimuli. We therefore investigated whether processes regulating mast cell chemotaxis are rate limiting for mast cell mediator release. In these experiments, we disrupted actin polymerization, a requirement for mast cell chemotaxis. We then examined chemotaxis and mediator release in human mast cells induced by antigen or SCF. We found and reported that disruption of actin polymerization minimally affected early signaling pathways, but attenuated SCF-induced human mast cell chemotaxis. Unexpectedly, in the absence of other stimuli, SCF induced substantial degranulation in a concentration-dependent manner following actin disassembly. We interpreted this data as consistent with the conclusion that processes regulating cell migration limit mast cell degranulation as a consequence of cytoskeletal reorganization."
"8761122","    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Levels of unintended fertility in the United States are high: half of all pregnancies and a third of all births are unintended, with higher levels among young adults and among race-ethnic-nativity minorities. Because unintended births are associated with negative health outcomes, higher rates of unintended fertility among minorities may exacerbate health disparities, and reducing unintended fertility has been a public health goal since the 1980s. Although the proximate determinants of unintended fertility are clear (sex without effective contraceptive use and carrying unintended pregnancies to term), the underlying causes of these behaviors, and of race-ethnic-nativity differences, are not well understood. Drawing on existing frameworks for understanding fertility differentials, this project proposes two key distal determinants - reproductive knowledge and fertility motivation - that may explain differences in unintended fertility across race-ethnic-nativity groups. The project wil test the hypotheses that race-ethnic-nativity minorities have lower reproductive knowledge and motivation to prevent pregnancy;that these differences widen during young adulthood;and that these distal determinants drive differences in the proximate determinants (primarily sex and contraception) and in fertility itself. This project moves beyond prior descriptive work to identif precursors of risky sexual behavior and unintended fertility during young adulthood, a life course stage that is highly variable yet understudied in the fertility literature. We also extend prior wok by incorporating both men and women as well as diverse race- ethnic-nativity groups. Our project will derive robust and consistent measures from three complementary datasets: the Relationship Dynamics and Social Life study (""RDSL"";a population-based sample of women aged 18-19 residing in a Michigan county in 2008/09, followed weekly for 2.5 years), the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (""Add Health"";youths enrolled in grades 7-12 in 1995 and reinterviewed in 1996, 2001/02, and 2007/08), and the 2009 National Survey of Reproductive and Contraceptive Knowledge (""Fog Zone"";a national sample of unmarried men and women aged 18-29). First, the project will create equivalent measures of the distal determinants across surveys and race-ethnicity-nativity, using factor and latent class analyses guided by integrative data analysis techniques. Second, cross-lag regression models will be used to examine the stability of these constructs as young adults learn and gain new experiences that may affect their reproductive knowledge and fertility motivation. Third, this work will use event history models to identify the elements of fertility motivation and reproductiv health knowledge that are most predictive of risky sexual behavior and unintended births. Findings will guide future research and interventions in targeting those at risk for unintended fertility and highlighting the most crucial domains for intervention. To disseminate our findings t policymakers and practitioners, we will work with a consultant from the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, a nationally respected, politically neutral, private advocacy organization.

"8690156","    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Synaptic plasticity is a fundamental feature of the nervous system that underlies neural development, adaptation and learning. There is growing evidence that deficits in the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity are involved in the pathophysiology of many psychiatric disorders, from schizophrenia to mood disorders. For this reason, NIMH has established as one of his strategic research priorities the study of brain plasticity ""at the cellular, synaptic, circuit, and behavioral level,"" with the final goal of ""determining the neurobiological bases of these processes."" This proposal will study humans and three animal models (flies, mice, rats) to test the novel and provocative idea that synaptic plasticity is adaptive up to a point, but beyond that point, or in vulnerable individuals, it can become maladaptive. The ""cost"" of synaptic plasticity is not often considered but may be crucial in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders, and will be assessed at the ultrastructural, cellular, circuit, and behavioral level. Our previous NIMH-funded work has established that the overall result of wake plasticity is a net increase in synaptic strength, which is renormalized by sleep. But what happens when plasticity is ""excessive,"" for instance because it is extended beyond the physiological range without intervening sleep? Based on preliminary results obtained in both animals and humans, we hypothesize that extended plasticity can lead to negative consequences on neuronal activity (OFF periods, performance deficits) and on cellular function/integrity (cellular stress, ultrastructural abnormalities). Aim 1 will use rats to test whether plasticity-dependent synaptic overload leads to the occurrence of neuronal OFF periods, local EEG slowing during wake, and performance impairment. It will also establish to what extent these effects are a region- specific consequence of plasticity, rather than a general effect of prolonged wake. Aim 2 will use high density (hd) EEG in humans to ask whether the local increase in EEG theta waves, which occurs during wake as a result of extended plasticity in specific brain circuits, leads to local performance deficits, locally increased sleep need, and o sleep-dependent restoration of function. Aim 3 will use flies and mice to test whether extending plasticity by prolonging wakefulness leads to cellular stress and subcellular damage, and whether doing so chronically under sleep restriction conditions leads to lasting cellular damage and cognitive deficits. Plasticity plays a central role in the life of every organism, but its coston neural structure and function may be substantial especially at vulnerable developmental times, such as adolescence, or in vulnerable populations, such as psychiatric patients. Demonstrating the cost of plasticity at the cellular and systems level will have clear practical implications forthe prevention and treatment of mental disorders.        "

This application focuses on the role of carbon metabolism pathways in the virulence of Shigella flexneri. Our data suggest that S. flexneri uses information about the available carbon sources to determine the attachment and initial steps in invasion of host epithelial cells. Once inside the host cells, the bacteria must adjust their metabolism to take advantage of the different carbon sources available in the intracellular environment. The carbon and other nutrient sources present in the host cell cytoplasm and the pathways used by intracellular Shigella to obtain these sources are largely unknown. The first specific aim is to define the carbon and nutrient sources available to S. flexneri in the intracellular environment of the host. Using metabolomics, we can assess the nutrients present in the cytoplasm of uninfected cells and follow changes in the metabolome during the course of infection. Once we have identified the carbon sources that are present, our second aim is to determine the pathways the bacteria use to assimilate these nutrients. We will use proteomic and transcriptomic analysis of the intracellular bacteria to define the carbon metabolism genes expressed by intracellular S. flexneri. These will be complemented by genetic analysis to determine which of the expressed pathways are required for, or contribute to, intracellular growth. We will construct mutants that are defective in one or more of the carbon metabolism genes expressed intracellularly and test their ability to invade and cause plaques. The third aim is to determine the mechanism by which a regulator of central carbon metabolism, Cra, is linked to S. flexneri invasion and cell-to-cell spread. A mutation in cra markedly increased S. flexneri adherence to epithelial cells but limited cell-to-cell spread, pointing to a link between S. flexnei carbon metabolism and virulence. We will use genetic and biochemical characterization of the cra mutant to determine the mechanism of Cra's effect on virulence. Taken together, the data generated in this study will provide essential information on carbon metabolism and its role in Shigella virulence, and will contribute significantly to our broader understanding of the physiology and metabolism of S. flexneri in the host cell environment. Such data are applicable to the design of therapeutics targeting intracellular S. flexneri, as well as to the design of vaccines based on antigens expressed when the bacteria are growing within host cells.

"8698894","   DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant):  Psoriasis, a highly prevalent disease of humans of unknown cause, is a chronic inflammatory disorder primarily involving skin, with distinctive clinical characteristics. With the newly developed tools that facilitate microbiome research, it now is possible to assess whether the cutaneous microbiome plays a role in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Preliminary data from our studies suggest that the cutaneous microbiome in psoriasis is complex and possibly different from normal. To deal with this complexity, we propose to examine the cutaneous microbiome in relation to psoriasis with explorations at several taxonomic and informatic levels. Our overall objective is to examine how changes in the normal cutaneous microbiome contribute to the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Since causality is complex and often difficult to prove, and beyond the scope of this RFP, our overall hypothesis is that there are alterations in the cutaneous microbiome in areas of skin affected by psoriasis in comparison with the range observed in clinically unaffected areas, or in healthy persons. We also hypothesize that the characteristics of the microbiome may affect clinical responses to the immunomodulatory agents used to treat psoriasis. An alternative hypothesis is that effective treatment of psoriasis with systemic immunomodulatory agents will not substantially affect the disordered microbial ecosystem. Such observations would provide evidence for the roles of the microbiota in this disorder. Since an important consideration in microbiome research is the optimal level (e.g. phylum, genus, species, strain, gene) at which to examine a scientific question, and we are not yet certain what are the optimal levels for psoriasis, this also will be examined. Our studies of psoriasis should allow development of both approaches and tools that will have general utility for microbiome research. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: 1. To understand the cutaneous microbiome species composition overlaying psoriatic lesions;2. To investigate differences in metagenome content for psoriatic lesions compared to normal skin;3. To identify differences in the transcriptional profiles of the microbiome and the host between normal skin and psoriatic lesions using high-throughput sequencing;and 4. To estimate the effects of systemic immunomodulatory therapy for psoriasis on microbiome composition. In total, these studies should help us understand the role of the microbiome in psoriasis pathogenesis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This is a project to understand the microbiology of psoriasis using molecular and genomic methods. We will compare patients with psoriasis and healthy individuals to learn the microbial species, genes, and gene products on the skin that differ between them.            "
"8622088","    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) result from genetic mutations in one of 42 different lysosomal proteins, 12 of which are involved in the enzymatic catabolism or degradation of sphingolipids and glycosphingolipids (GSLs). Although fully two-thirds of all LSDs have some CNS involvement that can result in progressive cognitive and motor decline, there are currently no effective therapies. There are, however, two effective approaches to treating LSDs in the periphery. The first is enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), in which the defective enzyme is supplemented with recombinant protein that has been terminally modified to be taken up into the lysosome. The second approach entails inhibition of GSL synthesis with small molecules (substrate reduction therapy or SRT), and this strategy has been clinically proven to be effective for the treatment of Gaucher type 1 disease. To date SRT has focused on inhibition of glucosylceramide (GlcCer) synthase, which catalyzes the first step in GSL synthesis. The only approved agent, miglustat, is a weak inhibitor which has limited efficacy only against Gaucher type 1 and possesses some off-target effects. A much more potent and selective inhibitor, eliglustat tartrate, is currently in phase 3 clinical trials for Gacher type 1 with reported efficacy superior to that of the ERT agent, imiglucerase. Unfortunately, eliglustat tartrate does not penetrate the CNS, so holds no promise for treating CNS-based LSDs. We recently demonstrated that a structural analog of eliglustat (CCG-203586), designed to be more CNS-permeable, was able to effect measurable reductions in GlcCer levels in the brains of mice. However, based on its close structural relationship to eliglustat, which is known to be rapidly metabolized in mice, it is unlikely that CCG-203586 will be an optimal probe for studying chronic inhibition of GSL synthesis in murine models of CNS-based LSDs. The overarching goal of this work will be to determine if SRT is an effective approach to ameliorating the symptoms of LSDs of the CNS. Our approach will be to: 1) optimize the CCG-203586 lead structure for metabolic stability and CNS-permeability without sacrificing potency, 2) evaluate the best new analogs for their degree of penetrance into the CNS of mice, and 3) select optimal probes for long-term studies in mouse models of the CNS-based LSDs: Sandhoff and Tay-Sachs. Our proposal is innovative in its use of physical property-based design to reduce recognition by efflux transporters (e.g. MDR1) at the blood brain barrier, and by the use of dual cell-based assays for GlcCer synthase inhibition that simultaneously measure both activity and recognition by MDR1. This work will be significant in allowing, for the first time, investigation o the effects of chronic inhibition of GlcCer synthase in the CNS on GSL dynamics and on development and progression of symptoms in animal models of CNS-based LSDs. Finally, the ultimate impact of our work will be progress toward the first therapy for an unmet medical need, viz. CNS-based glycosphingolipidoses.        "
"8643245","    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project is to enable the investigation of the solvation and electrostatic properties of macromolecules in biomedical research by supporting the maintenance and continued development of the open-source Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver and PDB2PQR software packages. An understanding of electrostatic interactions is essential for the study of biomolecular processes. The structures of proteins and other biopolymers are being determined at an increasing rate through structural genomics and other efforts while specific linkages of these biopolymers in cellular pathways or supramolecular assemblages are being detected by genetic and proteomic studies. To integrate this information in physical models for drug discovery or other applications requires the ability to evaluate the energetic interactions within and between biopolymers. Among the various components of molecular energetics, solvation properties and electrostatic interactions are of special importance due to the long range of these interactions and the substantial charges of typical biopolymer components. APBS is a unique software package which solves the equations of continuum electrostatics for large biomolecular assemblages. This software was designed ""from the ground up"" using modern design principles to ensure its ability to interface with other computational packages and evolve as methods and applications change over time. The APBS code is accompanied by extensive documentation for both users and programmers and is supported by a variety of utilities for preparing calculations and analyzing results. Finally, the free, open-source APBS license ensures its accessibility to the entire biomedical community. The use of continuum solvation methods such as APBS requires accurate and complete structural data as well as force field parameters such as atomic charges and radii. PDB2PQR provides a software solution for such parameterization as well as biomolecular titration state assignment and visualization capability to support use by researchers with a wide range of expertise.

"8588278","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We know much about HIV transcription and replication. During the past two decades, the roles played by basal transcription complexes, NF-kB and Tat in initiation and elongation of viral transcription have been placed on solid scientific foundation. In addition, the co-activator of NF-kB and the viral transactivator Tat, the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), has been demonstrated to phosphorylate the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), Spt5 from DSIF and RD from NELF, thus allowing transcription complexes to elongate. P-TEFb itself is under exquisite control in cells, which determines their state of differentiation and proliferation. At least three additional cyclin dependent kinases play a critical role in co- transcriptional processing of HIV RNA, namely Cdk11, 12 and 13, some of which affect 3'end formation (Cdk11) and others the complex splicing of viral transcripts (Cdk12/Cdk13). Recently, we found that the latter two bind CycK, which was thought previously to be another component of P-TEFb. Importantly, CycK does not bind Cdk9, which together with CycT1 or CycT2 forms P-TEFb. This proposal will address in intricate detail how Tat interferes with the formation of inactive P-TEFb complexes in cells, how certain inhibitors of histone deacetylases do the same and how these new CycK complexes affect the splicing of HIV transcripts. In the process, we will have learned how Tat sustains optimal viral replication in infected cells, how drugs such as HMBA, SAHA and specific HDACis perturb the metabolism of P-TEFb and how these new CycK:Cdk complexes affect RNAPII as well as alternative splicing factors. New targets for inhibiting HIV replication will be revealed together with candidate compounds that should find future clinical utility.      "

"8868210","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project is a partnership between prevention scientists and the Cherokee Nation Behavioral Health Services to create, implement and evaluate a new, integrated community-level intervention designed to prevent underage drinking and associated negative consequences among American Indian and white youth living in rural high-risk underserved communities. This trial will take place in northeastern Oklahoma, an area suffering from high rates of poverty and substantial health disparities. The proposed intervention builds directly on the results of multiple previous experiments with two distinct approaches-community environmental change and brief intervention and referral-evaluated alone and in combination using a factorial design. Direct- action community organizing, documented as effective in multiple previous randomized trials, will be used to address community issues related to alcohol use and commercial and social access to alcohol among adolescents. Our design and implementation of brief interventions differs in a fundamental way from typical implementations. Instead of SBIRT implemented in select limited numbers of clinics, emergency departments or schools, we will design a community-wide SBIRT intervention. The population-level brief interventions will include five key components: (1) brief one-on-one screening and motivational interviewing sessions, (2) gatekeeper training, (3) peer leader training, (4) family postcard campaign, and (5) community-wide media campaign. Five key research design elements optimize causal inference and experimental evaluation of the intervention effects: (1) a controlled interrupted time-series design, (2) random selection of towns, (3) random assignment to study condition, (4) a factorial design, and (5) multiple comparison groups. The primary design feature of this randomized trial is a controlled interrupted time-series design. The large number of repeated measures (a time-series) substantially increases internal validity (i.e., strength of causal inference) as well as statistical power over conventional pre/post community trial designs. Repeated assessments will measure implementation fidelity for each intervention component, and measure key proximal as well as the primary ultimate outcomes through survey, observation and archival sources. The primary study sample will include all high-school students within study towns. Weekly and monthly measurements will produce a time-series design with observations of youth nested within town over the four-year period. In addition to repeated cross-sectional samples, we will use participant identifiers to track the embedded cohorts over the four years. This innovative project, involving a strong partnership between established prevention scientists and leaders of the Cherokee Nation Behavioral Health Services, has the potential to transform alcohol prevention research and practice. Despite advances in prevention science and practices in recent decades, the U.S. continues to struggle with significant alcohol-related risks and consequences among youth. The proposed project will provide a rigorous evaluation of a new, integrated community-level preventive intervention."

Since 1994, with continuous funding from the NIH (NCRR/NIBIB), significant support from NSF and in partnership with many academic institutions and BNL, the Center has supported a large, international structural biology user community through the design, construction, and operation of multiple beamlines. The Center serves over 500 life-science users at the NSLS through the continuous upgrade, maintenance, and operation of beamlines that provide photons, advanced end-station instrumentation, and user support and training for a range of synchrotron biophysics technologies at the state-of-the-art. In this renewal proposal, the CSB will continue technology sores for: synchrotron X-ray footprinting, X-ray spectroscopy, and macromolecular crystallography. An Administrative Core will support these cores and Dissemination and Training Cores will supplement their activities. In the Research Base, for the three cores overall, we identify 176 Pls with 245 specific sources of funding (projects) including 230 peer-reviewed project grants (~200 from NIH). We propose to support 145 projects in macromolecular crystallography (100 PIs), 52 projects in X-ray footprinting (43 PIs), and 48 projects in X-ray spectroscopy (33 PIs) for the renewal.     The opportunity to considerably enhance the facilities available to this Research Base is based on a once in a generation opportunity provided by the opening of a new synchrotron ring, the NSLS-II. The CSB team, in collaboration with BNL has secured funding for new beamlines at this facility. During the first part of the renewal period, the CSB will complete beamline desig, purchase and fabricate equipment, and then by the mid-point of the grant period complete installation, then commission several state-of-the art beamlines. We will make the transition to vibrant user programs by the end of the grant period with robust scientific facilities, active dissemination and training program and novel scientific results. The outcome of the five-year period will be a Center that continues to be a magnet for world-class synchrotron biosciences research well beyond existing capabilities and productivity that can continue for many years into the future."
"8781972","    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  RAP as a therapeutic compound for neuronal regeneration after spinal cord injury Novoron Bioscience Inc. RESEARCH &RELATED Other Project Information 7. Project Summary There are an estimated 12,000 to 20,000 new cases of spinal cord injury (SCI) each year and 1.28 million people in the United States are paralyzed in some form due to SCI. Currently, there are no clinically available treatments that target the degraded myelin, one of the causes of regenerative failure in the central nervous system (CNS) after SCI. LRP1 was recently identified as a novel receptor of myelin-associated inhibitors (MAIs), the components of degraded myelin responsible for regenerative failure. We have shown in vivo that infusion of the LRP1 antagonist RAP into the injured spinal cord results in attenuation of RhoA, the critical neuronal signal involved in extrinsically-mediated regenerative failure. Direct inhibition of RhoA has been shown to enhance neuronal regeneration after SCI in rodent models and a pan-Rho inhibitor has shown evidence of efficacy in humans in exploratory clinical trials. However, current therapeutics have so far been limited to single dose administration. In contrast, RAP has been demonstrated to be readily available to the CNS from the peripheral circulation therefore making it amenable to repeated administration over time giving it therapeutic advantages over current pan-RhoA inhibitors. As beneficial results have already been observed using direct infusion to the injury site, we first wish to assess whether peripheral administration of RAP has comparable beneficial effects on the signaling events associated with regenerative failure after SCI. To accomplish this, an intravenous administration protocol capable of resulting in sufficient levels of RAP in the CNS must first be established. We will then perform long term studies (8-week injury course) to assess histological regeneration of damaged neurons, as well as evaluate the behavioral benefits over time such as improved locomotion, increased paw utilization, and response to external stimuli in affected extremities. We will also evaluate the effects of RAP infusion on immune infiltration and lesion formation. As LRP1 has been shown to be a critical facilitator of myelin mediated neuroregenerative failure, we hypothesize that therapeutic application of RAP to block the LRP1/MAI interaction will result in significant neuronal regeneration after SCI. Additionally, the unique biological characteristics of RAP such as CNS bioavailability could make it a superior, or perhaps combinatorial, therapeutic approach to the current pan-RhoA inhibitors. As such, RAP appears to be a high-value potential therapeutic for restoring function after acute spinal cord injury. This technology s protected by US patent pending (US2012/035125), which is currently in process of exclusive license to Novoron Inc. from the University of California San Diego.        "
"8636501","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding the mechanisms that control inflammation in the CNS is critical to finding therapies for limiting damage to the brain from pathogens or neurodegenerative disease. Yet our knowledge is primarily limited to the adhesion molecules that facilitate entry to this site and not the factors that influence inflammatory cells once within the brain. Infection with the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii leads to a chronic infection in the CNS with a continuous inflammatory response required in the brain to maintain latency. The absence of an appropriate immune response leads to the development of Toxoplasmic encephalitis (TE) and is therefore a common cause of AIDS related fatalities. Toxoplasma is an extremely common human infection, yet, in the immune- competent host there is no apparent pathology related to continuous inflammation in the brain. Thus, T. gondii infection leads to an immune response in the brain robust enough to provide protection against the parasite but sufficiently controlled to prevent immunopathology. A hypothesis being examined in our lab is that during chronic infection, cell migration can be guided in the brain by chemokine networks thereby controlling infection and limiting tissue damage. Recent studies of ours have demonstrated that following Toxoplasma infection, the presence of a reticular network is formed on which T cells migrate within the parenchyma of the brain. In addition, the chemokines CCL19 and CCL21 are significantly upregulated with cables of CCL21 associated with migrating T cells. These chemokines, known for their role in T cell and dendritic cell migration in the periphery, have not been well studied in the context of migration within the CNS. Experiments will be conducted to test the hypothesis that increased expression of CCL19/CCL21 in the infected brain is a mechanism to guide leukocytes within the brain parenchyma to control infection. Understanding how peripheral cells are directed to the site of infection and still prevent immunopathology in the CNS has direct relevance to controlling the multiple infectious pathogens that affect the brain. In addition, it may also lead to novel mechanisms to manipulate a pathological or deficient immune response in the CNS.      "
"8846753","This application is for an ICTSA to be established at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB). Our rationale is that UTMB brings depth to the CTSA consortium, because: we are the only academic health center with both an NIAID-funded Regional Center for Excellence in Biodefense and a National Biocontainment Laboratory;we are the only center with two NIH-funded translationally oriented proteomics centers in biomarker research;we have developed translational research programs with three national laboratories (the Galveston and Sandia National Laboratories and NASA);we have trained more underrepresented minority MDs than any non-historically Black institution in the US;we have the only approved PhD-awarding Clinical Science Training program in a public university in Texas;and we have the largest telemedicine operation in the world. In response to Hurricane Ike, we have established a richer outpatient clinical research network in South East Texas. Our ICTSA are to: 1. Facilitate translational research as a rigorous discipline;2. Develop translational research training programs at all levels in the graduate continuum;3. Effectively conduct and bridge step 1 translational research (Tl) to steps 2 (T2) and -3 (T3);and 4. Interface productively with the national CTSA Consortium. To accomplish these goals, we have organized our ICTSA into 12 ""Key Resources"" ~ combinations of university core laboratories and intellectual resources, integrated by a single point of investigator/trainee contact. This structure will make us more rapidly responsive to the needs of our investigators and trainees. In this application, our Key Resources are assembled to support the translational goals of exemplar multidisciplinary translational teams (MTTs), generally organized around our successful NIH- funded interdisciplinary research centers. Three overiying principles will guide our ICTSA's operations, to: 1. Employ proactive mechanisms in identifying new team-oriented research opportunities;2. Prioritize trainee involvement in a team-based culture;and 3. Integrate systems biological approaches into translational research. UTMB's senior leadership is providing significant new institutional resources, including establishing the Institute for Translational Sciences (ITS), our new home for translational research;new commitments of pilot grant support; administrative support;and support for a significant expansion of bioinformatics faculty. The ITS Director reports directly to UTMB's Provost, who is responsible for integration of research and education university-wide. We are thus well-positioned to achieve our goals, significantly transform clinical and translational research at UTMB, and contribute to the national CTSA Consortium. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The ICTSA will allow our researchers to more quickly and effectively translate basic science discoveries into improvements in human health. In particular this award will allow us to build teams of researchers with diverse skills who can work effectively towards a health outcome-related goal.

"8775460","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sarcopenia, defined as age related loss of muscle mass and muscle function and strength, is very prevalent among the elderly. Sarcopenia is one of the largest public health problems facing a rapidly increasing, aging population in the United States and leads to increased incidence of falls, fractures and associated morbidities. Previous observations from our laboratory, as well as from many other laboratories, have demonstrated the efficacy of 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutyrate (HMB) alone or in combination with other amino acids in enhancing muscle strength and function in young athletes. We have recently demonstrated that the combination of HMB with two other amino acids, arginine and lysine, was effective in increasing muscle mass in elderly men and women during a year-long prospective study. When analyzing the data (Preliminary Results), we demonstrated a close correlation between the levels of 25-OH Vitamin D3 in this population and the level of improvement in muscle strength. We noted that individuals with plasma 25-OH Vitamin D3 levels >30 ng/ml manifested muscle strength gains supplemented with HMB and two amino acids, while those with plasma 25- OH Vitamin D3 of <30 ng/ml did not. These data form the basis of our current hypothesis that the combination of HMB and Vitamin D supplementation will be synergistic and will result in significant enhancements in overall muscle strength, function and muscle mass. We propose these Phase I and Phase II studies to prove our hypothesis. The Phase I study will test the short-term (12-wk) efficacy of a combination of HMB and Vitamin D to prevent and reverse muscle sarcopenia and the associated losses of muscular strength and functionality in older adults. We plan to recruit 100 men and women who will be assigned to one of four dietary treatments: (1) Control;(2) HMB (calcium salt), 3.0 g/day;(3) 2,000 IU Vitamin D;and (4) HMB, 3.0 g/d + 2,000 IU Vitamin D. The subjects will undergo a 3-day per week exercise program, and body composition and strength will be measured at four week intervals. We expect to demonstrate the synergy between HMB and Vitamin D in this short study. Phase II will test the long-term (12-mos) efficacy of this synergistic combination of HMB and Vitamin D on the enhancement of muscle strength and functionality in the elderly, thus leading to improved quality of life. Phase II will include an exercise arm just like Phase I, but will also include a non-exercise arm because many elderly adults do not participate in an exercise program. In addition to body composition and function and strength data, muscle biopsies will be obtained and muscle fiber and proteomic analysis will be performed. We anticipate that the data generated will lead to further research looking at mechanism(s) involved in loss of muscle and muscle function in the elderly. Improvement in muscle strength and muscle function as well as improvements in body composition over the year-long study will be used to market a product containing HMB and Vitamin D.      "
"8704868","    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 37,000 people die in the U.S. each year just due to seasonal influenza outbreaks. Efforts to match each year's batch of prevailing influenza viruses fail to predict the strains that will spread in the U.S. 23% of the time. The influenza season of 2007-2008 was one example of the mismatch between prediction and actual strain prevalence. In that season, two of the three influenza strains were mismatched with the viruses that spread in the population leading to influenza infections in vaccinated individuals Therefore, year to year seasonal influenza antigen prediction is not optimal. Beyond seasonal influenza, more troubling is that it is impossible to predict the next pandemic strain of influenza despite our greatest attempts to monitor new out breaks. Even if the strain could be determined at the onset of the pandemic, the time needed to develop and produce an effective vaccine for world-wide distribution may take too long to provide a protective vaccine to the world population. We propose to create and test ""centralized"" influenza genes for the production of prophylactic cross-reactive immunity to combat both seasonal and pandemic influenza. Centralized antigens are antigens that have been computationally engineered to represent common or primordial antigen sequences shared by many or all current viral antigen variants. The advantage of using a centralized antigen is that the genetic distance from the vaccine strain to the challenge strain is half of that of a random antigen and a challenge strain. Therefore, unlike selected wildtype candidate antigens, centralized antigens have substantially higher general homology to all strains of influenza, increasing their ability to drive cross-reactive immune responses to control influenza variants. The specific aims of this study are 1) to create reassorted influenza viruses expressing centralized genes. These will include hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) for H1, H2, H3, H5, N1 and N2 subtypes. The centralized viruses (H1N1-con, H2N2-con, H3N2-con, and H5N1-con) will be used to make traditional inactivated vaccines. 2) In order to determine the most broadly protective vaccine, mice will be immunized with centralized and wildtype inactivated vaccines. The immunized mice will be challenged with divergent influenza viruses and the best vaccine will be determined by the ability to induce the broadest levels of protection. 3) The final goal of the study is to determine the effects of using a centralized influenza vaccine in the context of prior anti-influenza immunity. Vaccine safety is paramount and these studies will determine if boosting with centralized vaccines results in original antigeni sin and dominant non-neutralizing immune responses. A final analysis will be done in ferrets, since ferrets more closely resemble natural influenza infection in humans. The overall goal of this project is to determine if a centralized vaccine is capable of inducing cross-protective immunity against influenza virus with greater breadth than that of a traditional influenza antigen. The most broadly protective antigens, whether centralized or wildtype, could be used as a first line defense or backup vaccine against pandemic or ""weaponized"" influenza viruses in the case of vaccine mismatch or could be incorporated into the annual vaccine formulation.

"8728483","    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) typically has a favorable prognosis;however, patients with PTC carrying the BRAFV600E mutation show resistance to radioiodine treatment and have high rates of metastases and low survival rates. Inhibitors of BRAFV600E, including vemurafenib, have been tested recently as treatments for BRAFV600E-melanomas, with very promising results. However, development of secondary tumor resistance to these compounds has been reported. Another potential player in PTC aggressiveness is vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), a crucial regulator of angiogenesis. Sorafenib, which targets VEGFR2, was only partially effective against metastatic PTC, suggesting secondary resistance mechanisms to this drug as well. Our preliminary results show that metastatic primary human BRAFV600E positive PTC cells in vitro were resistant to high doses of either vemurafenib or sorafenib alone, but combined treatment with both drugs decreased cell viability by greater than 90%. BRAFV600E up-regulates VEGFR2 and pERK1/2 in PTC cells, triggering recruitment of endothelial cells and pericytes. We also observed upregulation of ACAC[unreadable] (metabolic gene) suggesting that BRAFV600E harnesses a metabolic response that promotes PTC metastasis, a novel mechanism. Our preliminary data also indicate that VEGFR2 is associated with neck recurrence in BRAFV600E PTC. Our objective is to determine how BRAFV600E and VEGFR2 fit into the autocrine and paracrine signaling pathways that control PTC cell progression. Our central hypothesis is that BRAFV600E and VEGFR2 pathways synergize in PTC cells, increasing secretion of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and leading to increased PTC cell adhesion, migration/invasion, and angiogenesis. We propose a secondary pathway in which the BRAFV600E/ERK1/2 signaling cascade triggers hyper-expression of VEGFR2 in PTC cells. The alternate VEGFR2 pathway synergizes with residual BRAFV600E activity in the presence of vemurafenib, conferring secondary drug resistance in PTC cells. We will test this by manipulating VEGFR2 and BRAFV600E function and assessing tumorogenic properties in our novel models: a 3D co-culture system that recapitulates the PTC microenvironment, an orthotopic mouse with primary human PTC cells with heterozygous BRAFWT/V600E, and ChIp-seq analysis. Aim 1: To elucidate the autocrine and paracrine pathways by which BRAFV600E and VEGFR2 promote PTC aggressiveness. These studies will delineate VEGFR2-interacting ECM proteins that enhance ERK1/2 phosphorylation in BRAFV600E PTC and provide new insight into vemurafenib and sorafenib secondary drug resistance. Aim 2: To assess whether VEGFR2 protein expression is a long-term prognostic biomarker for PTC aggressiveness in BRAFV600E PTC. Aim 3: To assess efficacy of anti-BRAFV600E and anti-VEGFR2 combined therapy in a pre-clinical mouse model of human heterozygous BRAFWT/V600E PTC. These proposed studies are highly likely to provide evidence supporting clinical trials of combined targeted therapy for BRAFV600E-PTC and identify novel targets for drug development and biomarkers for aggressive PTC.

"8627569","ABSTRACT: Novel adoptive T cell therapies have enabled long lasting objective clinical responses in a significant proportion of patients with metastatic melanoma. Treatment efficacy and availability could be further improved by ex vivo genetic modification of lymphocytes allowing generation of large numbers of cells with enhanced anti-tumor function. The development of such adoptive cell transfer immune therapies is critically dependent on the availability of tools to track the distribution of genetically modified lymphocytes following transplantation in melanoma patients. Work by Program Project Grant (PPG) Investigators in animal models of cancer and in humans has demonstrated that this goal could be accomplished using novel molecular imaging techniques such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET).  To visualize the distribution of genetically modified T lymphocytes and Hematopoietic Stem Cells transplanted in melanoma patients, these cells will be engineered to express a PET reporter gene derived from the Herpes Simplex Virus 1 thymidine kinase (HSVI-tk). HSVI-tk has been used extensively in clinical trials as a ""suicide gene"" and has a very high affinity for the PET probe (9-[4-[(18)F]fluoro-3-(hydroxymethyl)-butyl]guanine) (9(18)'F]FHBG). [9(18)F]FHBG administered in trace amounts accumulates specifically in cells expressing HSVI-tk and resulting signals can be detected by PET. We will use this technique for in vivo ""counting"" of genetically  modified cells at various sites throughout the body, including lymphoid organs and metastatic melanoma  deposits. Such measurements cannot be performed using conventional technologies and could provide eariy  prediction markers for therapeutic responses.  To support imaging studies by PPG Investigators, we propose to establish a Biological Imaging Core for noninvasive  monitoring of immune responses. This Core will complement state-of-the-art 'in vitro'immUne  monitoring measurements described in Core A and will enable PPG Investigators to pertorm preclinical and  clinical 'in vivo'immune monitoring studies using multiple imaging modalities.  The proposed Core will take advantage of the unique expertise and infrastructure for functional and anatomical  tomographic imaging already available at UCLA and will also coordinate preclinical imaging experiments  performed at other participating institutions. We envision that the Imaging Core will help cement long-term  interactive multi-institutional collaborations involving experts in imaging, gene therapy, basic and clinical  immunology, who are at the forefront of cancer immunotherapy transitional research."
"8593995","    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The goal of the proposed study is to develop and test an adjunctive intervention (CLASP) to reduce suicide behavior and re-hospitalization in military veterans hospitalized for suicidal behavior. Suicide is one of the leading causes of death for military personnel and for the first time in recorded history the rates of military suicides are exceeding civilian rates. Despite the public and patient health costs associated with suicidal ideation and behavior, existing efforts have not appreciably reduced the rates of suicidal behavior in the military. Consequently, finding novel, efficacious, and acceptable methods to reduce suicide behaviors is of great military health relevance and should be a fundamental goal of clinical research with military veterans. The Coping Long Term with Active Suicide Program (CLASP) is an adjunctive intervention that combines aspects of problem-solving therapy, case-management, family support, and assessment. The program is a 6- month, adjunctive, telephone-based program designed for patients hospitalized for suicide behavior. CLASP includes, 3 individual sessions and one family session conducted while a patient is in the hospital, and a series of phone calls to both the patient and an identified significant other over the course of 6-months post- discharge. The program is designed to be easily integrated into the VA's current system, can be delivered by master's level clinicians, and will expand on, and compliment the role of the National Suicide Coordinator.  The primary objective of this study is to test the efficacy of CLASP in a sample of veterans hospitalized for suicide behavior. Two hundred veterans will be randomly assigned to either the CLASP intervention or to a Safety Assessment and Follow-up Evaluation (SAFE) control condition. Both programs will be delivered as adjuncts to treatment as usual. Participants will be assessed at the end of the active intervention phase (3 and 6 months post-discharge from hospital) and again at 9 and 12 months post discharge. Efficacy of the program will be determined by several primary outcomes including number of attempts, number of re-hospitalizations, severity and chronicity of suicidal ideation. Secondary analyses will be conducted to help identify the types of patients who will receive the most benefit from the CLASP intervention.                  "
"8646901","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Substance  use  disorders  (SUD)  are  highly  prevalent  and  result  in  substantial  disability,  morbidity,  and  premature mortality. Research supported by the parent grant of this application (R01DA0191606) has helped to define risk factors for SUD.  Known  risk  factors  for  SUD  span  family  history,  poor  parenting,  traumatic  experiences, personality traits, and recent stressful life events, early-onset substance use, social deviance and  availability of substances. Despite impressive recent progress on the identification of risk factors for SUD, no explicit model has been developed and tested that defines the interrelationships among these variables.    Consistent with NIDA's Five Year Strategic Plan's Prevention Priorities 1 ""To identify the characteristics  and patterns of drug abuse"" and 2 ""To understand how genes, environment, and development influence the  various risk and protective factors for drug abuse"", and Cross-Cutting Priority 2 ""To decrease health disparities  related to drug addiction"", in this competing renewal, we seek to build a theory-driven, comprehensive model of  SUD and  examine  its  invariance  across  substances,  race,  and gender. We  will  use  data  from the  34,653  participants  in  Waves  1  and  2  of  the  National  Epidemiologic  Survey  of  Alcohol  and  Related  Conditions  (NESARC). Three complementary families of statistical techniques (GLM, Oaxaca-type decompositions and  structural  equation  models)  will  be  applied  to  guide  development  of  a  conceptual  model  based  on  the  pioneering research of Professor Kendler that focused on risk factors for major depressive disorder, and that  we have modified (e.g., by including availability of drugs) to study the etiology and course of SUD.   This modified Kendler model provides a comprehensive integration of variables from five developmental stages: childhood, early adolescence, late adolescence, adulthood, and the last year. The risk factors for this model were assessed in all NESARC participants and are widely considered to apply to SUD. Importantly,  many  of  the  risk  factors  are  modifiable  and  amenable  to  change  through  prevention  and  treatment  interventions. We propose to use the modified Kendler conceptual model to examine the following aims: 1) To  investigate the relationship between risk factors and prevalence of substance use and SUD~ 2) To determine  the relationship between risk factors and transition from use to SUD,  remission of SUD, and relapse~ 3) To  examine whether gender and racial/ethnic differences across the course of SUD are due to the differential  distribution or differential effect of the risk factors~ and, 4) To develop and test models of substance use, SUD,  transition from SUD, remission from SUD, and relapse.    At the conclusion of this study, we will have developed and tested a model that integrates a broad range of risk factors for the onset and course of SUD. These models will help to inform the development and targeting of evidence-based prevention and treatment interventions for SUD.                "

"8640066","    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The San Diego State University-Minority Health and Health Disparities International Research Training program (SDSU-MHIRT) will continue its eighteen year tradition of providing outstanding international biomedical research training experiences to students from health disparity backgrounds. SDSU-MHIRT encourages and supports its students so that they can successfully pursue careers in the fields of basic and biomedical science, and clinical and behavioral health, and most importantly increase the number of persons from health disparities populations who enter into the field of biomedical science/practice. Twelve trainees per year will perform original research in areas encompassing: public health, molecular biology/ethno-pharmacology, drug design and anticancer agents, behavioral science, marine science, and clinical research. Each foreign site is required to have adequate equipment and human or animal- subject research approval for the execution of the MHIRT trainees'research proposals. Mentorship will be provided at the international sites through both a US and foreign faculty mentor. Sites and mentors have been designated based on their ability to provide a sound research experience. There are several factors unique to this proposal. The first is that SDSU has recently been designated an Hispanic Serving Institution;this, coupled with our proximity to the US-Mexico border and our already thriving cross- border research relationships, affords up the opportunity to provide relevant research experiences to our students. Additionally, our MHIRT trainees will have an extended support system once they return to SDSU. The student-based international research experience is part of an integrated approach in which other training programs (e.g., MBRS, MARC) continue to support the students through their final years here. Major SDSU-MHIRT sites are in Ghana, Mexico, Peru, and Taiwan (Republic of China). A new site - Uganda - is being proposed. Since being awarded for this current cycle, the SDSU-MHIRT program has served 70 trainees. Of these, 9 have been accepted into, are in, or have completed PhD programs and 10 are in Master's programs. In addition, 10 are applying to r medical school, 2 have Fulbright awards, 2 are in the Peace Corps, 5 are working in the field, 2 have been accepted into Pharmacy School, and 30 are still completing their undergraduate education. The new cadre of MHIRT students for 2013 will consist of an additional 12 students taking part in the MHIRT program. In addition, in this cycle 52 publications were produced of which 27 had trainee authors. The program has compiled for the first time a digital database of ethno-botanical plants that is freely accessible n the web.

"8744820","Normal tissue toxicity to the gastrointestinal (Gl) tract occurs frequently with chemoradiotherapy and represents a major clinical challenge. Unfortunately, no effective treatments exist to combat this significant clinical problem. The luminal epithelia of the Gl tract exist in physiologic hypoxia, and thus hypoxic signaling is crucial to the their survival and normal functions. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HlF-1) is a transcription factor at the heart of the cellular hypoxia response whose levels fluctuate inversely with cellular oxygen tension. Stabilized HIF-1 expression has been shown to be critical for normal intestinal homeostasis as well as survival during inflammatory challenges. HIF-1 is required to maintain several basic functions of the intestine, such as barrier and absorptive functions. Augmenting HIF-1 expression in the intestine improves epithelial barrier functions, increases nutrient absorption and reduces apoptosis in response to infection and inflammatory stress. Conversely, intestinal specific knockouts of HIF-1 cause increased epithelial apoptosis in murine models of colitis. The oxygen dependent regulation of HIF is chiefly mediated through the prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD)-containing proteins which hydroxylate proline moieties on HIF, and serve as a recognition site for the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) protein, which targets HIF for proteasomal destruction. To date, three oxygen-dependent prolyl hydroxylases have been identified (PHD1-3), however, the roles of each isoform in intestinal homeostasis is not clear. Because PHD proteins regulate HIF levels, and HIF, in turn protects the gut from inflammatory stress, it is our hypothesis that the PHD proteins regulates radiosensitivity in the gastrointestinal tract, such that deletion of specific PHD isoforms will afford radioprotection of the gut through HIF-medlated effects on epithelial integrity and crypt regeneration. In this proposal, we will: 1) investigate the specific contributions of PHD 1-3 on radioprotecting the Gl tract from hypofractionated and fractionated radiation with Project 2 and Core B, 2) determine the mechanisms of radioprotection by PHD inhibition with Project 3;3) explore the role of PHD 1-3 in the radiation response ofthe intestinal stem cell with Project 2, 4) determine the efficacy of a small molecule PHD inhibitor to protect the Gl tract with Project 2;and 5) determine the therapeutic efficacy of PHD 1-3 knockouts and small molecule inhibitors of PHD activity on tumor growth in response to radiation relative to normal tissue radioprotection with Project 4. This project represents a new paradigm change in the development of radioprotectors in that we are investigating the physiological basis of tissue radioprotection through alterations in epithelial barrier function."
"8705323","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The scientific issues of this project are focused around four core developmental phenomena of the 18-23 year old period: 1) this period is normatively the highest alcohol consumption interval in the life course;2) toward the end of this interval, for the majority of young adults, a decrease in consumption begins to take place;3) for a higher risk subset of the population, the high consumption pattern continues;and 4) while these critical behavioral shifts are occurring, the neural networks responsible for effortful control and reward response/incentive reactivity are also maturing, albeit at different rates. Three corollary, as yet unanswered questions critical to both social policy about youthful drinking and intervention, are to be addressed: A) To what degree are the changes in drinking behavior taking place over this developmental interval attributable to the maturation of these neural networks?;B) Does heavy alcohol consumption influence the maturation of these networks?;C) How do social environmental reinforcers and prior individual differences in risk mediate or moderate both of these outcomes? During the past 5 years, this project has investigated neurocognitive and functional brain indicators of later problem alcohol use, identifying trajectories of problem use and neural indicators of risk and resilience. This revised continuation project builds on this prior work by extending the investigation into early adulthood and identifying effects of heavy drinking on personality, neurocognition and brain function as well as the interactions between early risk, heavy drinking, and social context (social supports, peer drinking, environmental insults) throughout adolescence and early adulthood. Subjects are participants in the Michigan Longitudinal Study, a high risk for alcohol use disorder family study that has been characterizing temperament, behavioral risk and social context since early childhood and neurocognitive risk since early adolescence. Associated brain function has been studied using fMRI since late adolescence in a subset of these participants. Over the next 5 years, the study will probe the two domains of Effortful Control, and Incentive Reactivity, assessed at the levels of brain function (Regulation/dysregulation of frontostriatal and frontolimbic circuitry and connectivity), neurocognition, and personality. Neurocognitive and personality assessments will continue at 3 year intervals (N= 1456), starting at age 12;a subset of participants (N = 225) will continue to be assessed yearly via fMRI starting at age 18. An important new focus of the imaging work is the interaction between frontal and subcortical processes, to be explored longitudinally using a delayed discounting task, and frontostriatal and frontolimbic functional connectivity analyses. Results will developmentally characterize the relationship between drinking behavior, social environment, and brain function and connectivity change. A special focus is the extent to which drinking behavior lags brain change or leads it, and the role that social environment plays in moderating such change.      "
"8600249","    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dopamine (DA) is a critical neuromodulator in neural circuits for motor control, cognition and reward. A chief target of DA modulation is signaling of the excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate. What are the basic principles for DA modulation of glutamatergic signaling and plasticity? Data addressing this question are maddeningly complex. Much of this complexity may be due to variations between cell types and circuits in which DA has been studied. What other factors might contribute to the heterogeneity? Using an ex vivo brain slice preparation of the nucleus accumbens (NAc)-a central component of the neural reward circuit-our pilot studies provide evidence for two additional factors: 1) in vivo exposure t novel stimuli and 2) the timing of DA signaling in relation to long-term potentiation (LTP) induction. We find that a brief exposure to novelty enables DA to induce a long-lasting depression in NAc AMPAR synaptic strength. We also find that prior DA signaling boosts the ability of tetanic stimulation to induce robust LTP. Using direct and sensitive electrophysiologica measures, we will investigate the roles for novelty and timing in DA modulation of NAc AMPARs. We expect our studies to inform new guiding principles for dopamine modulation in health and disease.    "
"8636891","    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cocaine abuse is a significant public health problem, with approximately 1.4 million Americans meeting the DSMIV criteria for cocaine dependence and acute overdoses causing nearly 500,000 emergency room visits each year. In spite of this, there are remarkably few effective treatments for cocaine addiction and abuse. Part of the difficulty in the medical treatment of cocaine addiction is that even after successful short-term treatment, environmental cues can evoke craving and drug relapse. Behavioral and neurobiological approaches to memory have identified extinction, in which the relation between the cue and the drug is severed, as a way to eliminate conditioned behavior. A challenge for extinction-based therapies, however, is that extinguished behavior often returns with time or after re-exposure to the drug. In our initial period of support, we examined pharmacological approaches that, when paired with behavioral extinction, generated a rapid and persistent loss of drug-seeking that was resistant to reinstatement challenges (relapse-like behavior). Our focus has been on the regulation of gene expression necessary for long-term memory formation, which involves the concerted action of multiple transcription factors and cofactors that interact with chromatin, a protein complex that packages DNA. Chromatin modification is a main mechanism of epigenetic gene regulation, which is emerging as a major molecular pathway involved in synaptic plasticity and memory storage.  Epigenetic gene regulation has been shown to underlie persistent long-term changes at the cellular level as well as the behavioral level. Importantly, in animal models of addiction, chronic drug exposure induces stable chromatin modification resulting in  stable synaptic plasticity changes, which is  thought  to  drive persistnt  changes in behavior. Considering the substantial overlap in the circuitry involved in drug addiction and learning and memory pathways, the focus of this grant proposal is to modulate learning and memory pathways in order to extinguish drug associated memories. In this renewal application, we focus on a specific mechanism of regulating histone acetylation via histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3). We use genetic, viral, and pharmacological manipulations to investigate the role of HDAC3 in extinction of cocaine-induced conditioned place preferences and intravenous cocaine self-administration. We hypothesize that HDAC3 is a key negative regulator of extinction of drug-seeking behavior and that HDAC3 modulates extinction via regulation of Nr4a (nuclear orphan receptor) gene family.  In Specific Aim 1, we will use a novel pharmacological approach to determine the role of HDAC3 specifically in memory consolidation during extinction. In Specific Aim 2, we will use a genetic and viral approach to determine the role of long-term modulation of HDAC3 in extinction. In Specific Aim 3, we will use a molecular approach to determine the role of the Nr4a gene family (HDAC3 target genes) in extinction. Our approach promises to elucidate behavioral, systems, and epigenetic mechanisms of extinction and elucidate novel molecular targets for pharmacological interventions.          "
"8740033","    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-infected individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART) are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), likely due to chronically increased inflammation. Low-dose methotrexate (LDMTX) appears to reduce CVD risk in people with rheumatoid arthritis, who like those with HIV, have increased levels of inflammation. The NHLBI recently provided funding for a clinical trial targeting the excess inflammation in HIV. That ""Parent Study"" is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that will assess whether 24-week treatment with LDMTX: i) is safe, ii) reduces circulating inflammatory biomarkers and levels of immune cell activation and iii) improves brachial artery reactivity. However, neither the biomarkers nor endothelial function tests measured as part of the parent study will report on atherosclerotic inflammation, (the desired pathobiological target of LDMTX therapy in HIV). As such, the direct evaluation of arterial inflammation would substantially enhance the scientific value of the trial.  We propose to conduct a time sensitive ancillary imaging study whose overall goal is to determine if treating virologically suppressed, HIV-infected individuals with LDMTX will reduce inflammation within the arterial wall. Atherosclerotic inflammation can be non-invasively and reproducibly measured with FDG-PET/CT imaging, a well-validated quantitative technique that can sensitively detect changes in atherosclerotic inflammation and which has been employed in several multi-center trials to measure changes in arterial inflammation in response to anti-inflammatory treatments.  Our central hypothesis is that persistent immune activation results in chronic arterial inflammation, which contributes to the CVD risk observed in HIV. This fully integrated ancillary study would, in a subset of patients enrolled in the parent trial: (i) assess the impact of LDMTX on arterial inflammation, (ii) evaluate mechanisms responsible for arterial inflammation in HIV and iii) explore mechanisms responsible for actions of LDMTX on the artery wall. Accordingly, the proposed study would provide unique and highly complementary information that would greatly increase the knowledge and mechanistic insights gained from Parent Study. The ancillary study has two specific aims1) To determine the impact of anti-inflammatory treatment with LDMTX on arterial inflammation, as assessed by FDG-PET/CT imaging, in virally suppressed HIV-infected individuals., and 2) To evaluate the cellular and biochemical basis of the effect of LDMTX therapy on arterial inflammation in HIV.  We expect that LDMTX therapy will improve arterial inflammation and that this mechanistic, proof-of-concept study will demonstrate the importance of inflammation and immune activation in HIV-associated CVD. This would thus form the basis for event-driven trials to evaluate whether anti-inflammatory strategies reduce CVD risk in individuals with treated HIV infection. Accordingly, the study has the potential to shift the paradigm in the approach to treating atherosclerosis in HIV-infected individuals, and potentially in other populations as well.        "

"8708207","    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive lung disease of unknown cause and increasing prevalence in the United States. An estimated 100,000 Americans will die from IPF this year, and aside from lung transplantation, which only 1% will receive, there is no FDA-approved therapy. Over the last decade, a potential role for gastro-esophageal reflux (GER) and microaspiration in the progression of IPF has been suggested. Both acid and non-acid reflux are likely important, and preliminary data from IPF patients suggest  an increased benefit of laparoscopic fundoplication over medical antacid therapy alone in slowing disease  progression. Laparoscopic fundoplication has been safely performed in patients with IPF and other forms of advanced lung disease awaiting lung transplantation. These data provide a compelling argument for a trial of laparoscopic fundoplication in patients with IPF and associated GER.  In the clinical proposal, we hypothesize that the reduction of abnormal GER with laparoscopic fundoplication will slow the progression of IPF as measured by the forced vital capacity (FVC). To address this hypothesis, we propose the following aims:  Aim 1: To determine the impact of laparoscopic fundoplication on change in FVC over 48 weeks in IPF.  Aim 2: To correlate the reduction in acid and non-acid reflux events with change in FVC over 48 weeks in IPF.  Aim 3: To determine the safety of laparoscopic fundoplication in patients with IPF.  Aim 4: To explore the impact of laparoscopic fundoplication on key secondary endpoints over 48 weeks in IPF.  In the ancillary proposal, we will test the hypothesis that abnormal GER contributes to the profibrotic  phenotype of lung epithelial cells in IPF by using molecular biomarkers in the serum, bronchoalveolar lavage,  and airway epithelial cells to assess the biological relevance of the presence and treatment of abnormal  GER.

"8652485","Sexually transmitted infections (STI) with Chlamydia trachomatis are the most common bacterial STI in both  the United States and worldwide and represent a significant public health concern. At present, there are no  biomarkers to reliably predict potentially devastating Chlamydia-associated reproductive complications, such  as infertility and ectopic pregnancy;therefore, development of a chlamydial vaccine is a high priority. The  traditional definition of ""protective immunity"" following chlamydial infection or vaccination includes reduced  bacterial shedding, shortened duration of infection, and diminished chronic tissue damage. However, the  immunologic correlates of protective immunity are less well-defined and have generally included generation  of IgG antibody and a robust CD4+ Th1 response although the latter has also been implicated in pathology  and may not be adequate as a single read-out for immunologic efficacy. The overall goal of this project is to  define the immunologic and cellular responses that contribute to effective generation of Chlamydia  muridarum-specific immunologic memory. We hypothesize that the CD4+ central and effector memory  phenotype elicited following C. muridarum Infection or immunization is a critical determinant of  protective immunity and/or pathology and, as a corollary, that altered IL-23/Th17 responses may result in  inadequate CD4+ T-cell memory responses. Employing a series of in vivo experiments in an established  mouse model, our hypothesis will be tested by the following Specific Aims: 1) Characterize the cellular and  immunologic responses associated with the development of protective CD4+ memory T-cell responses  following Chlamydia muridarum genital tract infection. 2) Evaluate the contribution of the IL-23/Th17  response in generation of effective CD4+ T-cell central and effector memory responses to C. muridarum  genital tract infection. 3) Determine if immunization with killed organisms elicits a different memory response  than natural infection. Information gained from the proposed studies will advance the Project Leader's  immediate and long-term career objectives to expand her technical and analytical research skills, develop  biomarkers for adverse disease outcomes following Chlamydia STI, and translate findings in the basic  immunology laboratory into clinically relevant prevention and intervention strategies for STI. The Project  Leader will integrate enthusiastic mentorship with numerous institutional resources to reach her goal of  becoming an independent investigator with an established scientific niche in genital tract mucosal  immunology."
"8646917","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary/Abstract Neuroimaging plays an increasingly important role in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The availability of data from large scale, multi-site studies, such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network (DIAN), provide unprecedented opportunities of improving our understanding of this complicated disease. On the other hand, these large scale, high dimensional imaging data of ever growing size call for the urgent needs of developing and validating robust and automated mapping tools. To become in independent investigator of brain imaging research in AD, the candidate proposes in this K01 application to receive training in multimodal image analysis, clinical diagnosis of AD, MR imaging techniques, and biostatistics. These training activities will greatly augment the candidate's background in neuroimage analysis and establish a solid foundation for his long term goal of being a leading researcher in computer-aided early diagnosis of AD. In the research plan, the candidate will develop and validate a suite of novel tools for the mapping of neuroanatomy during the development and progression of AD using intrinsic geometry of the anatomical structure. In contrast to conventional approaches that align brains in a canonical Euclidean space such as the Talairach atlas, the candidate models the anatomy intrinsically with the eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami (LB) operator and their Reeb graphs. This spectral approach is invariant to natural pose variations, robust to geometric deformations due to pathology and disease progression, and leads to novel methods for surface reconstruction, modeling, and mapping. The specific aims are: 1. Validate and continue to develop an intrinsic framework for the mapping of sub-cortical structures based on the LB eigenfunctions. 2. Develop and validate an automated system for cortical surface extraction, major sulci identification, and mapping. 3. Develop and validate novel algorithms for multimodal fusion with cortical mapping. The new algorithms will be validated with cognitive measures using data from ADNI and DIAN, and compared with existing methods in terms of the discrimination power in the early diagnosis of AD. The software tools developed in this project will be distributed publicly.      "
"8786925","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Brain metastases pose a significant problem for women with advanced metastatic diseases. The rate of brain metastasis has increased significantly in the last 10 years, approaching or exceeding 35% in subpopulations of metastatic breast cancer patients, particularly those with Her2+ or ""triple-negative"" tumors. After diagnosis of multiple metastatic lesions, patients typically die within one to two years. Gap: Treatment of brain metastases is primarily palliative due to limited curative effectiveness of radiation, surger, and poor delivery of chemotherapy across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This proposal focuses on preventing metastasis seeding and initial growth in brain using preclinical models. Hypothesis: By reducing the efficiency of metastatic cancer cell penetration into brain and increasing drug delivery and efficacy in early micrometastatic lesions, we will decrease large metastases development and improve both neurological function and overall survival. Aim 1: Demonstrate that brain invasion of metastatic breast cancer cells can be inhibited at the level of the BBB: Preliminary data indicate TGF-[unreadable] inhibition reduces brain invasion, at the level of the BBB, of triple negative human metastatic breast cancer cells in vivo ~70-80%. This work is extended to characterize mechanisms of how TGF-[unreadable] inhibition reduces BBB cell invasion and the role Her2+ plays in BBB invasion. Aim 2: Elucidate the causal relationship between blood-tumor barrier permeability changes and chemotherapeutic uptake and effect in brain micrometastases of breast cancer: Preliminary data suggest that, contrary to common assumptions, most micrometastatic lesions (<500 [unreadable]m diameter) of breast cancer in brain show marked changes in metastatic vasculature structure and function, including vessel co- option, reduced vascular density, enhanced permeability, and elevated VEGF expression. In this Aim, work will be completed to characterize BBB changes in micrometastases, with the goal of identifying selective difference in micrometastases, such as VEGF and Notch, which can be used for targeted therapeutic benefit. Aim 3: Develop novel strategies to modulate blood-brain barrier permeability to improve therapeutic efficacy for brain micrometastases treatment: Preliminary data demonstrate that inhibition of vascular endothelial Notch signaling in both large and small brain metastases in the presence of VEGF results in targeted increases in BBB permeability. In this Aim, the targeted increases in permeability are exploited to improve chemotherapy delivery, cytotoxic effect and overall survival in three preclinical tumor models. Impact: The goal of this proposal is to develop novel approaches to reduce breast cancer cell invasion to brain, to modulate BBB permeability and improve chemotherapy uptake into CNS metastases, with an overall purpose to reduce brain metastases related death. The work requires state-of-the-art cell targeting, BBB permeability, and drug distribution methods to link barrier changes in selected small tumors with overall brain metastasis invasion and growth."
"8644916","    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than a decade of research has established that sleep plays a critical role in memory consolidation, contributing to its stabilization, enhancement and integration into existing cortical networks. Despite the critical role of sleep in memory and cognition, abnormal sleep has generally been overlooked as a potential contributor to cognitive deficits in schizophrenia (SZ). This oversight is important as effective treatments for cognitive deficits are lacking and abnormal sleep is a potential treatment target. A burgeoning literature suggests that sleep spindles mediate sleep-dependent memory consolidation and cognitive function more generally. At the same time, several recent studies show that sleep spindles are dramatically reduced in SZ. Our preliminary data are the first to link the sleep spindle deficit wih the impairment of sleep-dependent memory consolidation in SZ that we have now documented in four independent studies. They also provide the first demonstration of reduced coherence of spindles across the cortex. Reduced spindle activity also predicted increased severity of positive symptoms and neurocognitive deficits. The observed spindle abnormalities implicate dysfunction in the spindle-generating thalamocortical feedback loop, which is regulated by both [unreadable]-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic and N-methyl-D-aspartate acid (NMDA) receptor mediated glutamatergic neurotransmission, all of which have been implicated in the pathophysiology of SZ. The primary goal of the proposed study is to replicate and extend the findings of our placebo-controlled, double-blind pilot study that eszopiclone (Lunesta), restores sleep spindles and sleep-dependent consolidation of motor procedural memory in SZ to normal levels. Eszopiclone is a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic agent that acts on GABAA receptors in the thalamic reticular nucleus where sleep spindles are generated. We will also determine whether there is more general impairment of sleep-dependent memory in SZ by examining the consolidation of other types of memory that are known to be impaired. Finally, we will establish the clinical relevance of abnormal sleep in SZ by correlating spindle activity and other sleep parameters with cognitive deficits based on standard neuropsychological assessment, symptom presentation, and functional capacity. In summary, our preliminary data suggest that abnormal spindles impair sleep-dependent memory consolidation in schizophrenia, contribute to positive symptoms, and are a promising novel target for the treatment of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. This project is novel and both clinically and scientifically significant in that if ur hypotheses are confirmed, it will link a specific cognitive deficit to a particular mechanism and provide an effective intervention. Thus, the proposed research program has the potential to substantially expand current models of cognitive deficits in SZ and to lead to interventions that significantly improve the quality of life of individuals with SZ.

"8605875","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Regulation of fat storage, release and secretion is key to metabolic health. Redox is an important mediator of cell function within cells that is communicated among cells by blood metabolites. Extracellular redox is sensed by fat cells, via metabolites and amino acids, where they may function as master regulators of adipocyte fuel handling and adipokine secretion. The circulating redox metabolites are produced by cells and link all tissues of the body: couples include the thiol (SH/SS) ratios, reflected in the cysteine/cystine and GSH/GSSG ratios, the mitochondrial redox state reflected in the ss-hydroxybutyrate (ss-OHB)/ acetoacetate (Acoc) ratio (B/A) and the cytosolic redox state reflected in the lactate/pyruvate ratio (L/P). Redox ratios change in response to metabolic status (high fat diet, fasting, diabetes), aging, and oxidative stress. Many observations support a causal relationship between redox changes and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS). During the prior grant period, we demonstrated that adipocytes generate ROS via a mitochondrial mechanism and that scavenging ROS with pyruvate stimulated O2 consumption. We also found that consumption of the ROS scavenger, n-acetyl cysteine, increased respiration and decreased body fat in vivo. Our long-term goal is to improve metabolic health by regulating adipose tissue function. In this application we will identify conditions where redox-mediated ROS generation alters lipid metabolism, adipokine secretion and mitochondrial responses to variations in the extracellular B/A or L/P ratio or thiol oxidation state and applying these findings to animals. We propose that the mechanism for ROS induced regulation of lipolysis involves mitochondrial autophagy and regulation of ROS levels. The application will explore the hypothesis that redox, as a master regulator of metabolic and mitochondrial responses, regulates generation of ROS, the fate of fuels, and adipokine secretion via mitochondrial bioenergetics and autophagy. Aim 1 is to determine the most effective way to impact lipolysis, triglyceride synthesis and adipokine secretion and determine how such changes relate to intracellular redox and ROS generation. These studies will define the metabolites or couples that modulate adipocyte function and the interrelationship if any among them. Aim 2 is to determine the mechanism of RS-induced functional changes on lipid handling and secretion by assessing the effect of the couples on mitochondrial bioenergetics, autophagy and dynamics. These studies will provide mechanistic information and identify proteins whose modification impacts cell function. Aim 3 is to translate redox and RS-induced lipid handling and adipokine secretion by feeding or infusion into animals. These studies will provide the essential underpinning for future human studies to test the validated concepts. The outcome of these studies will determine the feasibility of applying natural redox mechanisms to regulate adipocyte lipid handling and adipokine secretion to improve metabolic health caused by excess fat tissue.

"8789432","The various forms of the HIV-1 envelope (Env) glycoproteins do not serve as ideal immunogens because  they poorly induce Abs (Abs) with broad anti-viral functions, and the Ab response lasts <6 months. To  overcome these limitations, epitope-scaffold immunogens can be used to focus the Ab response on  vulnerable sites on the Env;however, the design of HIV epitope-scaffold immunogens has been fraught with  many failures. Nevertheless, epitope-scaffold vaccines candidates have been successfully developed  against influenza and Neisseria, and we and others have succeeded in designing several V3-scaffold and V3  peptide immunogens with demonstrable antigenicity and immunogenicity, resulting in the induction of HIV-1  cross-clade neutralizing Abs. In this Project, we propose to focus the immune response on the V2  region of gpl 20. Until recently, this region was virtually overlooked as a target for vaccine development,  but its importance as a vaccine target has been recently supported by data showing that anti-V2 Abs can be  highly cross-reactive, display neutralizing activity, capture virus particles, and block gp120/a4p7 interaction.  Support for pursuing V2 as a promising antigen for vaccine design also comes from pilot studies with  specimens from the RV144 clinical vaccine trial. For this Project, we will apply the platform we developed for  generating V3-scaffold immunogens to the production of V2-scaffold immunogens to be used for boosting  the Ab response after priming with DNA Env. For Aim 1.1, we will construct V2 inserts for scaffolded  immunogens based on the fine specificity of human V2 polyclonal and monoclonal Abs (mAbs), and on  bioinformatics and molecular modeling data. In Aim 1.2, we will assess the prevalence and function of anti-  V2 Abs of different specificities and clarify how these differ relative to the infecting HIV clade. For Aim 1.3,  we will select and characterize new human V2-specific mAbs derived from non-clade B-infected donors from  Cameroon infected with the clades that induce the most broad and functional anti-V2 Abs. Finally, after  selecting V2-scaffold proteins which, from the results of Aim 1.2 and 1.3, react with the most broad, potent  and multifunctional anti-V2 polyclonal and mAbs, we will, in Aim 1.4, test the immunogenicity of selected V2  scaffold boosting immunogens in rabbits and non-human primates after priming with Env DNA. The  ultimate goal of this Project is to induce antl-V2 Abs in rabbits and non-human primates that display  cross-clade anti-viral activities that mediate protection."
"8733196","    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research offers a unique opportunity to provide exposure-response estimates between measured occupational biomechanical stressors, non-occupational physical activities, demographics, medical history, psychosocial factors;and risk of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), lateral epicondylitis (LEPI), and medial epicondylitis (MEPI). Three prospective cohort studies will pool data from 35 US workplaces, representing a wide range of occupations, industries, and physical exposure levels. 1,973 employees were enrolled and 1,698 were followed for up to 110 months (average follow-up = 34 months). Comprehensive data are available on each worker's biomechanical stressors, physical examination maneuvers, and median and ulnar nerve conduction studies at the wrist. Exposure-response relationships will be estimated between biomechanical stressors and the prevalence and incidence of: CTS, LEPI, and MEPI, while adjusting for relevant effect modifiers and confounders. Measures of biomechanical stressors used in this study include established models of ACGIH Threshold Limit Value (TLV) for Hand Activity Level (HAL), and the 1995 Strain Index (SI), as well as newly developed models: (i) Revised Strain Index (RevSI), (ii) Composite Strain Index (COSI), and (iii) Cumulative Strain Index (CUSI). Comprehensive physical exposure data from these studies feature: (i) individual worker exposure with changes in exposure over time, and (ii) detailed data for each combination of force, repetition, and posture (sub-task data). These data allow us to model biomechanical stressors in detail not previously possible using innovative approaches such as RevSI, COSI, and CUSI. The three sites all have comprehensive data on potential confounders and covariates including worker demographics, past medical history, non-occupational hobbies and activities, and psychosocial factors. All sites used matching case definitions for CTS, LEPI, and MEPI that included symptoms plus physical maneuvers and nerve conduction studies. Pooling existing data across the three studies will enable us to estimate the magnitude and shape of the relative risk function across a wider range of biomechanical stressors: (i) with improved confidence and precision, (ii) for workers with job rotation, and (iii) for tasks with multiple combinations of force, repetition, and posture. Results from this proposed research will help employers to design safe and productive jobs and provide public-health agencies and occupational health researchers with information to more effectively guide prevention programs.

"8729690","    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive renewal application to study the role an atypical homeodomain protein called Hopx that is expressed in the heart. My laboratory discovered Hopx about 10 years ago, and we have shown that it functions, at least in part, by recruiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) to transcription complexes. This work, funded by this grant, led to numerous high-profile publications, patent applications, and it has spurred our efforts in collaboration with the private sector to translate the findings and bring new therapies for heart failure to the clinic. Our mechanistic studies have shown that Hopx does not bind directly to DNA, but that it is a component of cardiac repressor complexes. Hopx is expressed by cardiac progenitor cells at early time-points of murine embryogenesis, just after Nkx2-5, at ~E8.0, and inactivation of Hopx leads to partially penetrant embryonic lethality and thin myocardium. Cardiac progenitors that express Nkx2-5 are multipotent and can produce myocardial, smooth muscle or endothelial lineages. However, Hopx-expressing progenitors are committed to the myocardial lineage. Our data suggest that fate decisions of cardiac precursor cells are biased by Hopx dose and activity. We hypothesize that Hopx is an extremely early (perhaps the earliest) marker of committed myocardial cells and that Hopx functions to reinforce the myocardial lineage choice by recruiting HDACs and other transcription cofactors to repress critical mediators of alternate fates and of the multipotent state. Understanding how myocardial fate decisions are executed and reinforced will inform our ability to enhance regenerative therapies and instruct stem and progenitor cells to produce functional myocardium.

"8605301"," ABSTRACT: The human infant is typically sterile in utero and then born into a world dominated by microbes, which selectively assume residence of the body surfaces and enteric tract of the newborn. The assembly of the early human microbiome is particularly an issue relevant to the very low birth weight (VLBW;<1500 g) infant, where infection and activation of immunological and inflammatory responses produce acute morbidity and mor- tality and exacerbate co-morbid diseases of the eyes, enteric tract, and central nervous system. However, the selective forces that alter primary colonization and secondary persistence of more or less pathogenic microbes within the developing microbiota are not well understood, particularly in humans. Specifically, the extent to which colonization is recognized by the adaptive immune response and how the adaptive responses contribute to shaping the microbiome of the premature infant, and how the microbiome influences concurrent and subse- quent adaptive immune development, is poorly understood. The immediate goal of the proposed research is to identify antigens from the pioneering microbiome of the intestine in the preterm infant that are recognized by natural birth antibodies and the adaptive humoral response. This work will then determine whether and how the peripheral and mucosal antibody response alters the dynamics of secondary colonization. The central hypoth- esis is that natural antibodies present at birth modify primary colonization while antigens of pioneering Gram negative enteric bacteria drive adaptive antibody responses that alter secondary colonization and long-term immune memory. The hypothesis will be addressed through an innovative combination of molecular tools in the following aims: 1) To determine the relationship between natural and adaptive antibodies and colonization of the VLBW infant intestinal tract, 2) To determine the specificity of breast milk IgA to the breast milk microbi- ome and the early intestinal microbiome in the VLBW infant, and 3) To measure the specific antigens of the neonatal microbiome recognized by antibodies in the first year of life. These studies will uniquely define the constellation of antigens recognized by preterm infant and maternal natural and adaptive antibodies as the in- fant becomes colonized. By determining the dynamic interface between mucosal antibody response and spe- cific antigens recognized by the newborn human host, new interventions may be envisioned through which to alter primary and secondary colonization of infants through stimulation of natural and adaptive antibodies. In turn these advents may lead to approaches to alter long-term outcomes including infectious diseases, allergy, and metabolic syndrome."

"8701176","Clostridium difficile is a toxin-producing bacterium that is a frequent cause of hospital-acquired and  antibiotic-associated diarrhea. The incidence and severity of C. difficile infection (CDI) are increasing, in parallel with increases in community-acquired infections, making CDI a major public health problem.  Following inoculation, patients may clear C. difficile from their intestinal tract, become asymptomatically colonized, or develop CDI, ranging in severity from mild diarrhea to fulminant colitis and/or death. Older adults are disproportionately affected by CDI, experiencing greater morbidity and mortality. Antibiotics treat CDI, but refractory disease and relapses occur. Major gaps exist in our understanding ofthe host and microbial factors that determine the outcome of human contact with C. difficile. The broad objective of this ERIN CRC is to develop innovative approaches to the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of CDI based on understanding the molecular mechanisms of disease. The goals of this Proiect are to use genomic information obtained from clinical C. difficile strains, to identify microbial determinants of infection and develop a rapid, high-throughput assay to predict the clinical behavior of individual C. difficile strains. We hypothesize that there is a genomic basis for the different clinical presentations of C. difficile (colonization, mild or severe infection, and relapse) in susceptible hosts. The Specific Aims of this  proposal seek to: (1) Establish a collection of isolates that spans the genetic diversity of C. difficile  associated with both asymptomatically colonized adults and those with initial and recurrent infection;(2) Perform a comparative phylogenomic analysis of representative C. difficile isolates obtained from Aim 1;and (3) Develop a high-throughput single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) typing system for the rapid discrimination and risk-assessment ofC. difficile infection. This project will collect clinicoepidemiological data, biological specimens and C. difficile strains, which will be used in all three major projects of this ERIN."
"8832003","    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, approximately 7 million Americans use hearing aid devices, which usually use compact Zn-air batteries. These batteries are relatively inexpensive, safe to use, and easy to dispose of, but only work for approximately 1 week before needing to be replaced. Practically all other modern gadgets (cell phones, computers, etc.) now utilize rechargeable lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries, which have lower charge capacity and need frequent (practically daily) recharging. Although frequent recharging may be acceptable for gadget users, it may create potentially a life threating situation for users of medical devices. Th frequent need to replace or recharge hearing aid batteries creates a logistical problem for users, especially for seniors, who constitute the largest segment of hearing aid users. In response to the NIH National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) request for new rechargeable batteries for hearing aid devices, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new High-Capacity Li-ion Rechargeable (HCLIR) battery. The significant (fourfold) increase in the battery capacity, compare to the current capacity of Li-ion batteries wil be achieved with a new silicon (Si) microporous anode. Si has an outstanding lithium (Li) insertion capacity, which is 10 times higher than conventional graphite, but suffers from large volume changes while absorbing and releasing Li. The proposed anode structure not only significantly increases surface area available for the reaction with Li, but also permits material extension, thus allowing for multiple charge/discharge cycles. As a result of this innovation, the proposed compact battery (size A312) will be capable of storing energy sufficient for approximately 1 week of hearing aid operation without recharging. Users will be able to recharge the battery using the same (or similar) charger they use for their cell phones and other gadgets, with an additional compartment for a small size battery. The cost of the proposed battery will be completely recovered after several months of use, while its service life will be several years long. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed A312 size battery with a Si microporous anode by optimizing the battery design, fabricating battery prototypes, measuring their capacity, and demonstrating their capability to withstand multiple charge/discharge cycles. In Phase II, POC will optimize the manufacturing technology to reduce battery cost. We will also certify the developed battery according to ANSI/IEC requirements. Successful accomplishment of the proposed development will directly benefit millions of hearing aid users. The proposed technology can be modified easily for use in other medical devices and for a broad commercial market for numerous electronic devices which utilize Li-ion batteries.        "
"8757072","    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the amended competing renewal application of the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN), a 7-site longitudinal cohort study initiated in 1994 in response to RFA AG-94-002. SWAN was mandated ""to characterize the chronology of the biological and psychosocial antecedents and sequelae of the menopausal transition (MT) and the effect of this transition on subsequent health and risk factors for age- related disease"", and to extend this information from White women to ""...the range of peri-menopausal experiences in women of other racial/ethnic background(s)."" A total of 3302 Black, Chinese, Japanese, Hispanic and White women were enrolled, with 78% completing up to 13 visits spanning the premenopause to early post-menopause (PM). Thus far, SWAN has described the natural history of the MT -- its timing, patterns of hormonal changes, and symptoms and factors related to them - and their relation to disease risk indicators. During SWAN V, we will extend observations through the late PM, a necessary step to assess the impact of the MT on age-related diseases. Our specific aims are to: 1) complete the characterization of the natural history of reproductive aging through the late PM;2) evaluate the impact of reproductive aging through the late PM on health outcomes clinically relevant to women in their 60s and 70s, including: cognitive and physical function, psychological well-being, sleep, bone and cardiometabolic health, urogenital symptoms, sexual function and vaginal health;and 3) identify potential underlying mechanisms linking reproductive aging and health by assessing the relation of inflammation, hemostasis and adipokines to the occurrence and progression of biological, functional and clinical outcomes and delineating the interrelationships of body size and composition, race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status with these outcomes. The SWAN V Core protocol will be completed at 7 study sites, with bone and cardiovascular studies at 4 sites and actigraphy studies in a subset of women at all sites. Longitudinal specimens from the SWAN Repository will enable characterization of skeletal markers, adrenal hormones, hemostasis, inflammation, and adipokines across the MT into PM. The Coordinating Center will provide the necessary organizational infrastructure, statistical resources, and timely dissemination of high quality SWAN data. The CLIA-certified Central Laboratory will perform or coordinate with other laboratories to provide accurate, high volume assays, adopting new methods as needed to provide state- of-the-art data. SWAN is uniquely positioned to fill important scientific gaps in understanding of the impact of the MT on women's health in their 60s and 70s and to facilitate the application of new knowledge to clinical practice. With 1.5 decades of both calendar time and ""menopause time"", SWAN V can disaggregate the contributions of aging and the MT to women's health, address difficult and critical questions about the temporal nature of MT-disease associations, assess differences by race/ethnicity, and provide insights into modifiable factors relevant to the design of innovative prevention and treatment programs for aging women.

"8695864","    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The basic concept of personalized medicine is to tailor the treatment for a patient based on his or her genetic makeup, clinical conditions and other personal characteristics to improve efficacy and safety. The coming of the big data era enables us to characterize individual in fine pictures and make the ""personalized"" clinical decision truly personalized. Such an approach has great potential for improving disease prevention, diagnosis and treatment. For example, in a typical randomized clinical trial aiming for proving the efficacy of a treatment, the final conclusion is drawn based on the average treatment effect in the entire study population. It is possible that while the average treatment effect is near null, the treatment may still be beneficial to a subgroup of patients whose identification prior to the treatment is thus very important. The overall objective of statistical analysis in this area is to provide a data-based empirical estimator for the personalized treatment effect, which can be used to identify subgroup of patients who may benefit the most from a treatment. In this study, we first propose to develop robust statistical methods for estimating the group-specific treatment effect. The proposed approach incorporating many existing methods as special cases depends on minimum model assumptions and provides a general framework for generalization and improvement. We will also discuss how to use the estimated personalized treatment effect to stratify patient population into clinically meaningful strata for better assisting the decision making of clinicians. Secondly, we will study a regularize principal components analysis method for dimension reduction in structured high-dimensional data. The output from the analysis can be used to summarize the characteristics of individual patient as well as for predicting future clinical outcomes of interest. Multiple methods can be used to estimate the treatment effect and form the corresponding treatment selection strategy. Therefore it is important to evaluate and compare the performance of such strategies. Thus our last aim is to develop a systematic robust procedure for evaluating the performance of the personalized treatment effect estimation and associated treatment selection strategy.        "

"8640933","    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The modern world has experienced enormous growth in obesity, a disease associated with increased incidence of and mortality from diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer. Even moderate weight loss in the range of 5-10% has been shown to prevent the long-term consequences of obesity. Unfortunately, the current treatment options for obesity remain limited in both their application and effect.  Our preliminary data indicate that sarcolemmal ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels limit muscle energy expenditure under physiological workload, while KATP channel deficit provokes an extra energy cost of muscle performance. Inefficient fuel metabolism in KATP channel-deficient muscles reduces body fat deposits promoting a lean phenotype. The current proposal builds on this finding to determine the mechanisms by which KATP channel function affects skeletal muscle performance, and adipose tissue mobilization.  We hypothesize that membrane potential modulation, due to KATP channel opening in response to a physiological workload, limits calcium and sodium inward currents and thus energy consumption related to ion homeostasis and contraction continuation. Under conditions of surplus calorie intake this promotes weight gain. Conversely, disruption of KATP channel function would result in exaggerated cellular calcium turnover, causing increased energy consumption and activation of calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase (Ca2+/CaMKII). We propose, that induction of CaMKII triggers both Akt-dependent production and Ca2+- dependent secretion of a signaling peptide - musclin. This peptide is known for its ability to modulate clearance of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) - a potet activator of lipolysis. In this way, musclin signaling could translate increased activity related energy consumption into adipose tissue mobilization. The goal of this project is to directly study the molecular mechanism of KATP channel control of activity- related energy consumption and the mechanism of consequent adipose tissue mobilization and body weight reduction.  The proposed investigation will be performed across multiple models - biochemical and electrophysiological studies on cellular and isolated organ levels will be used to verify molecular mechanisms for findings obtained on the whole body level. Understanding these mechanisms will provide novel avenues for targeted management and prevention of obesity and related diseases.        "
"8675250","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In crowded visual scenes, attention is needed to selectively process information from relevant stimuli and to filter out irrelevant distracters. Accordingly, studies in humans and animals have shown that neurons in several different brain structures show enhanced responses when attention is directed into their receptive fields. However, there is still little understanding of how these ubiquitous attentional effects are actually generated through the interactions among these structures, particularly when the attentional cues arise from cognitive factors and task demands. To design an effective neural prosthesis or to treat people with attentional disorders, we need a better understanding of attention at the systems level. Three key structures thought to provide feedback to visual cortex that mediates attentional effects are the prefrontal cortex, the posterior parietal cortex and the pulvinar. In the planned experiments, we will compare the roles of each of these three structures in providing feedback to area V4 in visual cortex. Area V4 plays a central role in the relay of visual information along the ventral stream that underlies object recognition, and we have previously shown that V4 neuronal responses are modulated by attention and that damage to V4 causes attentional impairments. We have also recently shown that neurons in prefrontal cortex have attentional latencies that are short enough to mediate some of the attentional effects on V4 neuronal responses, and that prefrontal neurons have coherent activity with cells in V4. This coherent activity is time-shifted across a wide range of frequencies by about 10 ms, which may be the critical time to allow for functional interactions. In Aim 1, we will add recordings from the posterior parietal cortex to the prefrontal recordings, to compare the roles of these two structures in modulating activity in V4. The pulvinar provides an alternative anatomical route for signals from prefrontal and parietal cortex to influence V4. Therefore, in Aim 2, we will record simultaneously in the pulvinar and area V4, to test whether pulvinar neuronal properties are consistent with this feedback role. However, neurophysiological recordings alone can only provide evidence for correlations in activity, not for causality. Therefore, in Aim 3, we will supplement the neural recordings with suppression of activity in prefrontal and parietal cortex and pulvinar, to test causal hypotheses about the role of feedback from each structure in modulating V4 responses. For these experiments, we will use techniques that we and our collaborators have recently developed for the optogenetic suppression of neural activity using the proton pump, Arch-T, which is delivered by lentivirus. With Arch-T we will be able to suppress activity with resolution in the tens of milliseconds, at critical time points, to gain new mechanistic insights into the feedback to V4. In total, we expect these studies to give us the best account so far of how the interactions among multiple brain structures leads to effective visual processing with attention.       "

"8660058","    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Developing a Diabetes Numeracy Intervention for American Indians/Alaska Natives Project Summary Patients with diabetes must engage in a variety of self-care behaviors, including appropriate dietary practices, blood glucose self-monitoring, and medication management. Important to each of these behaviors is the capacity to understand and use numbers (e.g., counting carbohydrates). Referred to as ""numeracy,"" such abilities are associated with a variety of diabetes self-care behaviors and outcomes (e.g., glycemic control).  Although the prevalence of diabetes has raised nationwide, American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) are diagnosed with diabetes at 2-3 times the rate of non-Hispanic Whites. And, yet, Native people are at risk for limitations in the numerical skills that are criticl for diabetes management. Although deficits in numeracy are widespread, such limitations are particularly common among racial/ethnic minorities and individuals with limited income and education. As a result of restricted educational opportunities and high rates of poverty in many AI/AN communities, Native people with diabetes are at risk for limitations in diabetes-related numeracy.  Despite evidence of a link between numeracy and health, no interventions aimed at improving health- related numeracy have been published. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and pilot test an intervention to improve diabetes-related numerical skills among AI/ANs with diabetes. The aims of the project are the following: (1) To develop a culturally appropriate intervention to teach the numerical skills required for successful diabetes self-management;(2) To assess change in numeracy skills following intervention;and (3) To explore change in diabetes self-efficacy, self-care behavior, and clinical outcomes following intervention and to assess whether change in numeracy predicts change in these secondary outcomes.  The INTervention to Enhance Numeracy in Diabetes (INTEND) will be adapted from two existing numeracy curricula - Extending Mathematical Power (EMPower) and Statistics for Action (SfA) - which were developed to teach adults the math skills needed to manage everyday numerical tasks. The project team, which includes experts in AI/AN health and diabetes numeracy as well as the developers of EMPower and SfA, will adapt these curricula to address diabetes management among AI/ANs. The INTEND will be tested in a randomized controlled trial involving 130 AI/AN patients with diabetes from Yakama Indian Health Center in Toppenish, WA. Analyses will assess whether patients who participate in the INTEND show significantly greater improvement in numeracy, self-efficacy, self-care behavior, and clinical outcomes than do control patients.  As no interventions designed to improve health-related numeracy have been reported in the literature, this innovative project will advance science related to numeracy and highlight a new avenue for intervening with AI/ANs and other populations at risk for diabetes and its complications. As similar numerical skills are required in the management of other serious health problems, such as cardiovascular disease and hypertension, the results of this work may inform the development of effective interventions for other conditions as well.

"8690788","    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this proposal is to develop further potential glycomarkers we have identified for pancreatic cancer and breast cancer, as well as to discover new glycomarkers by detailed glycomic analysis of the tumor initiating cells (TIC) of pancreatic and breast cancer and of tumor-associated ""stellate"" cells that surround pancreatic cancer. Clearly, developing biomarkers for pancreatic and breast cancer is of critical importance in the early detection of cancers. During the first cycle of the NCI U01 focused on Glycans and Cancer, we analyzed pancreatic ductal fluid from those with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and controls using glycomic analysis tools developed in our NCRR Resource for Biomedical Glycomics. We have identified several potential glycomarkers that will be developed in this competitive renewal application. Most notably, we have identified a unique N-glycan that shows promise as a sensitive and specific marker of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. In addition, we developed a Targeted Glycoproteomics technology and used it to identify potential markers in invasive ductal breast carcinoma tissue. Two glycoprotein glycomarkers were identified and verified in serum samples. A newly devised sandwich ELISA to detect the specific glycoform of one of these markers shows promise in distinguishing serum from patients with breast cancer and those with benign polycystic disease. In the discovery Aim of this proposal, we will prepare TIC from pancreatic adenocarcinoma by cell sorting and apply glycomics technologies to identify differences between TIC and differentiated tumor cells. A similar strategy will be utilize using cultured breast cancer cell lines. As we have during the first cycle of the U01, we will exploit these differences by devising serum assays to identify potential glycoprotein glycoform markers. Similarly, we will analyze tumor-associated fibroblastic ""stellate"" cells from pancreatic cancers and grown in culture for potential glycomarkers. These cells surround these cancers and may, therefore, secrete or release potential glycomarkers for the cancer that can be detected in serum.            "
"8939807","Previously we have studies the contribution of histone modifications, DNA methylation and their regulatory enzymes to transcriptional regulation in a variety of cellular systems. Our latest efforts have focused on how histone variants contribute to the regulation of chromatin structure and transcription.    Nucleosomes are present throughout the genome and must be dynamically regulated to accommodate binding of transcription factors and RNA polymerase machineries by various mechanisms. Despite the development of protocols and techniques that have enabled us to map nucleosome occupancy genome-wide, the dynamic properties of nucleosomes remain poorly understood, particularly in mammalian cells. The histone variant H3.3 is incorporated into chromatin independently of DNA replication and requires displacement of existing nucleosomes for its deposition. However, it is not clear how deposition of the histone variant is regulated. We developed a system to study the DNA replication-independent turnover of nucleosomes containing the histone variant H3.3 in mammalian cells. By measuring the genome-wide incorporation of H3.3 at different time points following epitope-tagged H3.3 expression, we find three categories of H3.3-nucleosome turnover in vivo: rapid turnover, intermediate turnover and, specifically at telomeres, slow turnover. Our data indicate that H3.3-containing nucleosomes at enhancers and promoters undergo rapid turnover that is associated with active histone modification marks including H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K27ac and the histone variant H2A.Z. The rate of turnover is negatively correlated with H3K27me3 at regulatory regions and with H3K36me3 at gene bodies.  In addition, we have worked with our collaborators using model systems including Drosophila flies and chicken to investigate the contribution of chromatin and epigenetic mechanisms to cellular memory and differentiation."
"8694239","    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The prognosis for pancreatic cancer (PC) patients is dismal, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 6%. This is in part due to the propensity of PC to metastasize prior to disease detection and the resistance of these metastatic tumors to cytotoxic therapies. A significant portion of therapeutic resistance in pancreatic cancers comes from the support of a unique tumor microenvironment. This tumor microenvironment includes significant numbers of infiltrating myeloid cells including tumor-associated macrophages, which exacerbate responses to therapy by inducing immunosuppression and increasing the presence of cancer stem cells. Thus, where clinically feasible reprogramming the immune microenvironment would improve responses to cytotoxic therapy even in resistant tumors. One unique approach to this problem is to target the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R). Previous studies have shown that genetic loss of colony stimulating factor-1, a critical cytokine for the recruitment, survival, and activation of macrophages, can decease the progression of mammary and neuroendocrine pancreatic tumors. Our own work has shown that inhibiting CSF1R can vastly improve responses to chemotherapy and decrease metastatic spread in pancreatic tumor models. We have now extended these observations and demonstrated that CSF1R inhibition 1) rapidly reprograms tumor-infiltrating macrophage responses, 2) decreases the frequency of tumor initiating cells, and 3) leads to recovery of anti-tumor cytotoxic responses by neutrophils and T lymphocytes. In so doing, CSF1R inhibition reprograms the tumor microenvironment to increase responses to chemotherapy and decrease metastatic spread. Thus, our hypothesis is that blockade of CSF1R signaling reprograms the tumor microenvironment to improve responses to chemo- and immunotherapy. The long-term goals of the proposed studies are to initiate new clinical trials testing this approach in metastatic PC. However, in order to inform these trials and test our overall hypothesis the following specific aims are critical. Aim 1: Determine the mechanisms by which macrophages regulate metastatic relapse. Aim 2: Determine the functional role of CSF1R blockade in granulocyte reprogramming. Aim 3: Determine the optimum therapeutic regimen for targeting CSF1R to improve immunotherapy. These Aims form the basis of our proposed studies, which will use a combination of clinically translatable agents and genetic mouse models to: 1) fundamentally understand the biological underpinnings by which myeloid cells regulate chemotherapeutic response. And 2) to identify and validate targets to exploit these biological processes for therapeutic benefit. Thus, this application will develop targeted inhibition of CSF1R as a novel immunotherapeutic agent to improve outcomes for pancreatic cancer patients.          "
"8627970","    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Living cells gain energy for growth and survival by transferring electrons between the products of catabolism and a suitable electron acceptor. The most favorable terminal electron acceptor is oxygen, but in oxygen-poor environments most cells use other soluble factors to accept the electrons generated by metabolism. Bacteria in the genus Shewanella can actually use solid extracellular metals as substrates for respiration, and they have evolved a series of periplasmic and outer-membrane proteins to serve as a direct electrical junction with these metals. Several members of the shewanellae have clinical relevance as opportunistic pathogens, and the basis of their unique respiratory abilities thus warrants further investigation. Furthermore, the existence of a genetically-encoded pathway between manufactured circuits and the central metabolism of living cells opens new vistas in studying and engineering microorganisms. Recent results suggest that these conduits can also pass current in reverse, allowing extracellular electrons to enter the cell and drive synthetic processes. If combined with carbon fixation, applied current could make a versatile input for the production of high-value chemicals, including pharmaceuticals. This proposal outlines research to characterize and improve the capacity of Shewanella cells to accept electrical current, using electrically active bioreactors in combination with microscopy of cells expressing fluorescent protein sensors, transcriptome sequencing, and reverse genetics assays. Finally, a strain of E. coli expressing genes from Shewanella will be constructed in order to define an efficient genetic circuit conferring electron uptake.        "
"8733718","    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal builds upon the accomplishments made during the previous funding period and requests continuing support of the Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) on Obesity and Cardiovascular Diseases (COCVD). Kentucky ranks within the top 10 states for the prevalence of obesity and cardiovascular diseases, and the epidemic is not abating. Thus, it is imperative that mechanisms linking obesity to cardiovascular diseases are identified. During the 4 years of support the COCVD has made significant strides advancing knowledge on obesity-associated cardiovascular diseases through support of junior investigators and the development of research cores. As a result, we have experienced outstanding success, with graduation of 75% of 12 supported junior investigators to independent R01 support, including 15 new NIH R01s. The program has graduated 2 junior faculty/year to NIH R01 level support, with 125 publications from junior investigators, and an additional 318 publications from mentors. In addition, we have supported 7 pilot projects that have contributed to 58 publications. New research cores to quantify obesity phenotypes and to provide analytical services in lipidomics have markedly increased the research infrastructure. As a direct result of COCVD activities, the institution competed successfully for a CTSA to establish the Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences. In the second phase of the COCVD we propose to create a nationally recognized Center of Research Excellence to define mechanisms linking the epidemic of obesity to cardiovascular diseases, the primary cause of death in the obese population. To accomplish this goal, we will (1) develop a critical mass of funded investigators including basic and physician scientists with research programs directly related to the Center's unifying theme, (2) provide strong mentoring programs, (2) recruit new investigators to the Center through pilot project grant support, which will be leveraged by the institution and the CTSA, (4) expand and further develop an Analytical Core (with a focus on lipidomics), a Physiologic Core to quantify obesity and cardiovascular phenotypes, and a Pathology Core to assess tissue histology.

"8726764","    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, caregiver intervention is the sole method of mitigating seizure-related adverse events, and there are few options for indirect monitoring on a daily basis. Approaches for non-clinical settings have included nocturnal bed sensors and accelerometry-based sensors, but these have suffered from low sensitivity (e.g., only detects nocturnal or tonic-clonic seizures) and high false-alarm rates. Investigators at RTI International and Children's National Medical Center (CNMC) propose a joint effort to develop a novel seizure alert system for daily monitoring and caregiver alert. This system will target the well-documented physiological effects due to elevated activity of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) during seizures that can be measured with unobtrusive, comfortable sensors. A multi-sensor approach will be used to increase sensitivity and precision for the detection of all generalized seizures and some types of partial seizures, excluding absence and simple partial. The overall performance objective is to demonstrate that significant seizures can be identified 95% of the time with a false event rate of less than 10%. Preliminary data collected from 16 subjects suggest that successful detection of seizures with a multi-sensor approach is highly probable. By decreasing response time and eliminating the need for constant observation, this system could have a substantial and measurable impact on the epilepsy community by decreasing the number of seizure-related injuries and deaths, improving quality of life, increasing independence for both patients and caregivers, and reducing the cost of treatment. The research plan discusses three specific aims. Aim 1: Develop and validate seizure detection algorithm with clinical data. It is hypothesized that significant seizures can be detected with hig sensitivity and precision using multiple physiological indicators of ANS escalation, including changes in heart rate and variability, respiration, skeletal muscle activity, and sweating. An automated detection algorithm will be developed and validated that uses a multi-sensor data fusion and pattern recognition approach to classify seizure and non-seizure states. Aim 2: Develop integrated prototype seizure alert device. A fully integrated prototype system will be developed, including a compact, wearable monitoring device and a remote caregiver alert unit based on robust methodology using quantitative clinical results, feedback from potential end users, and state-of-the-art technological advancements. Aim 3: Validate prototype in clinical and residential settings. The prototype seizure alert system will be tested for performance and overall usability during a clinical study at CNMC. Forty-five patient-caregiver pairs will use the system in clinical testing to assess detection performance, followed by at-home testing to assess device effectiveness, practicality, and comfort for daily use in a realistic environment.

"8689138","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number one killer and a major cause of disability in the United States. Emerging data suggest that overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays a causal role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and other CVD. Reactive nitrogen intermediates such as peroxynitrite (ONOO-) and nitrogen-dioxide radicals, formed by rapid reaction between nitric oxide (.NO) and ROS, react with carbohydrates, DNA bases, protein tyrosine/tryptophan, and unsaturated fatty acids to form relatively stable nitrated products. In the past eight years, our research team has revealed that a novel class of nitrated unsaturated fatty acids (NO2-FA) is generated by NO- mediated oxidative reactions and exerts pleiotropic cell signaling actions with a property of anti-oxidative stress. Recently, we have well documented that NO2- FA exerted anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) via activation of Nrf2 with an increase in Nrf2 stability in vitro. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that NO2-FA inhibited vascular lesion formation after arterial injury. These key results let us to test our central hypothesis that NO2-FA-operated Nrf2 signaling play a critical role in protecting vasculature from vascular lesion formation, thereby contributing to maintenance of vascular homeostasis. As Nrf2 signaling is critical for the anti-oxidative defense in various organs including the cardiovascular system, understanding of the endogenous NO2-FA-operated Nrf2 signaling will provide novel insights into redox homeostasis and the development of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of CVD. Specifically, we will 1) Define NO2-FA-operated Nrf2 signaling in the control of VSMC fate in vitro;2) Define the mechanisms of NO2-FA- mediated Nrf2 activation in VSMC;3) Determine the NO2-FA-operated Nrf2 signaling as a ""vasculo-protective"" determinant in vascular lesion formation in vivo.

"8601161","This grant alms to understand the chemoattractant pathways that control the recruitment of Th2 effector  lymphocytes into the airways in human asthma. Since allergen-specific Th2 cells play a key role in the  pathogenesis of asthma, understanding the mechanisms that control their specific recruitment into the ain/vay  has the potential to lead to new more specific therapies for allergic asthma while leaving overall T cellmediated  lung immunity to viruses and other import human pathogens intact. In the 3.5 years of this R37  award, we have made significant progress towards this goal, and have also made some important related  discoveries concerning chemokine control of Treg trafficking into the allergic lung and the ability of lung  dendritic cells to imprint lung homing of T cells. In this project period, this grant has supported our work  resulting in 9 original publications (7 from the Pis laboratory), 6 reviews, 1 commentary and 2 book chapters.  In the prior funding period, we have identified CCR4 as an important chemokine receptor that participates in  the control of Th2 cell recruitment into the airways in asthma. We also found that Tregs are recrOited into the  lung in allergic pulmonary inflammation via a CCR4-dependent pathway where they have the ability to  s.uppress allergic pulmonary inflammation. Since CCR4 only accounts for -50% of the Th2 cell trafficking  signals, we clearly need to identify the other relevant chemoattractant pathways. In addition, since CCR4 is  also important for Treg cell recruitment into the lung, the identification of additional chemokine pathways that  participate in Th2 cells trafficking into the allergic lung could allow the specific targeting of Th2 cells, leaving  Treg recruitment intact. In the MERIT extension period we will generate a CCL17 and CCL22 dual reporter  mouse to determine the pattern of CCR4 ligand expression in the lung and lymph node in allergic pulmonary  inflammation. We will also image the influence of chemokines on Th2, Treg and DC interactions in the lung  using confocal and multiphtoton intravital microscopy. In addition, we will determine the chemokine  receptors responsible for lung-specific homing and identify the lung DC subset that imprints lung-specific  homing. In the prior funding period, our analysis of human T cells recruited into the airway following allergen  challenge was restricted to bulk T cells, which include many bystander T cells. In our extension period, we  will build upon our work using MHC class II allergen-specific tetramers to precisely define the chemokine  receptor phenotype of allergen-specific T cells recruited into the lung. This is very important because in  order to define the chemoattractant receptor pathways critical for pathogenic T cell recruitment into the  airway in asthma, we need to define the relevant pathway for the critical cell, the allergen-specific T cell."
"8691819"," Abstract Many environmental stressors have deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions, by a variety of mechanisms, and with timelines of different lengths. Mitochondrial dysfunction has multiple clinical presentations, often delayed from the onset of organelle damage. At present, biomarkers that report on mitochondrial function, to enable population studies of environmental exposures and their consequences, are lacking. We propose to identify candidate biomarkers using a metabolomics approach, in greater depth than has previously been applied to toxicologic investigations.  Metabolomic analysis provides a window on cellular and organismal functions, closer to the actual physiology than genomic or transcriptomic arrays. Using multiple platforms for separation and mass spectrometric resolution of complex mixtures, a comprehensive set of metabolites including organic acids, amino acids, steroids, complex lipids, energy charge and mitochondrial transport metabolites can be targeted. We will use this technology to develop biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction that will fill an important gap in current studies of environmental toxicology.  We will focus our studies on a polybrominated diphenyl ether, BDE-47, that is emerging as one of the major persistent organic pollutants in the U.S. Published data from our collaborator, Dr. Kavanagh, and our preliminary data indicate that BDE-47 impairs mitochondrial function in cell lines in vitro. Metabolites in extracellular media (metabolic footprinting) will be analyzed with primary mouse hepatocytes, one of the main targets of BDE-47 toxicity, as a function of dose and time of exposure. We will also test the hypothesis that fatty acid overload will uncover subtle mitochondrial defects by performing metabolomic analysis in isolated mitochondria. These studies will provide metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity that will next be extended to in vivo studies of plasma and urine from BDE-47 treated mice. The possibility that lymphocytes may be a surrogate tissue for the mitochondrial toxicities of BDE-47 will be examined using the fatty acid overload assay.  The effects of genetic background and environment on BDE-47 toxicity are poorly understood. We will test two potential modifiers: 1) genetically engineered mice with low and high glutathione levels, and 2) fatty liver due to vitamin A deficiency. These experiments will provide novel information on potential high risk populations for BDE-47 exposure. A key question for these studies will be whether candidate biomarkers scale with toxicity (in addition to exposure dose).  In addition to discovering metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity, we will examine two recently described mitochondrial responses to stress by metabolic footprinting: 1) mitochondrial proteotoxicity due to aggregation of unfolded/unassembled proteins, and 2) alternative fumarate respiration in response to hypoxia and distal block of the electron transport chain. By selecting defined mitochondrial responses, one adverse and one adaptive, we begin to categorize mitochondrial dysfunction and look for signatures that associate with specific types. In the case of fumarate respiration, a signature of high levels of succinate in secreted metabolites is already known.  This work is a close collaboration with Oliver Fiehn, expert in metabolomics screening and data analysis, and Terry Kavanagh, an expert in oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicology."

The objective ofthis study  is to investigate the mechanisms of neuronal-epithelial communication between the submandibular gland  (SMG) and the parasympathetic submandibular ganglion during embryonic development. The specific aims  are to: 1) determine the mechanisms by which acetylcholine released from the neurons influences epithelial  morphogenesis, and 2) determine the mechanisms by which the neurotrophic growth factor neurturin, which  is secreted from the epithelium, influences neuronal function and epithelial morphogenesis. Goals include:  elucidating the signaling pathways activated by the nerves that govern epithelial progenitor ceil self-renewal  versus differentiation, investigating the influence of acetylcholine/musarinic/EGFR signaling on progenitor  cell migration and polarization, and identifying the mechanisms by which neurturin promotes both epithelial  and neuronal survival and regeneration after gamma radiation-induced injury. These goals will be achieved  using well-defined ex vivo SMG and organotypic culture models in conjunction with genetic, biochemical,  immunochemical, and fluorescence imaging techniques. These studies will facilitate our understanding of  how salivary glands develop, repair, and regenerate, with the long-term aim of providing therapeutic  approaches for re-establishing glandular structure and function after disease or injury."
"8728960","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  Robust regeneration of tissues and complex organs is the norm for countless invertebrate and nonmammalian vertebrate species. In addition, nature has endowed certain animals with remarkable longevity and robust tissue repair mechanisms that slow aging-induced degenerative processes, or with increased susceptibility to cellular and molecular damage and concomitantly short lifespans. Numerous fundamental questions in regenerative biology can only be answered in vivo using diverse non-mammalian animal models. In addition, comparative studies of diverse organisms provide deeper mechanistic insights that are not possible using a single model or ""model-centric"" approach, and they can speed the pace and reduce the cost of biomedical discovery. The Comparative Animal Models Core builds on MDIBL's unique strength and expertise in comparative animal biology and will provide COBRE investigators with resources necessary to utilize diverse animal models in regenerative and aging biology research. For the current application, the Core focuses primarily on providing resources and services to COBRE Project Leaders for their proposed zebrafish studies. These resources include day-to-day husbandry, importation and quarantine services, spawning services to produce embryos for experimental studies, microinjection and surgical services, drug treatment services and genotyping using visual inspection and PCR-based methods. The Core will also have both the facilities and expertise necessary to provide COBRE associated investigators as well as potential new COBRE Project Leaders with resources for other vertebrate and invertebrate model systems useful in regenerative and aging biology research including C. elegans, amphibians and various fish species.  Our long term goal is to develop the Core into a one-of-a-kind animal resource by leveraging the scientific background and expertise of the Core Director, his staff and MDIBL's faculty, as well as MDIBL's 113-year history of providing and maintaining diverse marine organisms for biomedical research. The Comparative Animal Models Core will thus contribute not only to the success and long term sustainability of the COBRE, but also to the success and continued growth of MDIBL and biomedical research in Maine."
"8631055","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to identify the molecular alterations that occur in the progression from ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to invasive breast cancer. This is of critical importance because it is only after the milestone of tissue invasion has been achieved that a cancer has the potential to metastasize and kill a patient. Invasive breast cancers harbor multiple molecular alterations that were sequentially acquired during progression from ADH to ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to invasive breast cancer. We will identify the genetic alterations that may be specific to DCIS or may be cumulative with increasing malignant potential. 7Rationale: While the cure rate for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is over 90%, this comes at the cost of considerable treatment-related morbidity. We urgently need the prognostic markers that would identify key genetic alterations predictive of the long-term outcome of DCIS, since most DCIS never become invasive carcinomas, presumably because they lack critical genetic changes, the replicative lifespan, or simply the time necessary to do so. Our experimental design exploits recent technological developments that permit genome- wide testing of DNA samples for genetic and epigenetic alterations, even in the very limited material available from archival DCIS samples. DCIS may represent a stage at which various pathways of clonal evolution are attempted, until a particular combination of genetic and/or epigenetic changes allows tissue invasion. Indications are that genetic mutations and epigenetic silencing may both be operative in carcinogenesis, and that these alternatives may be used interchangeably, even in a complementary fashion in the same cancer cell. Therefore, a combined analysis of both types of alterations is necessary. 7Design: This study is designed as multicenter, longitudinal, case-control study of DCIS. We have identified unique cohorts of pure DCIS cases with known outcomes to enable a multicenter genome-wide screening study of 100 cases and 100 controls, which will be initially limited to patients of Caucasian origin in order to obtain a homogenous patient population and maximize the probability of successfully validating our hypothesis that prognostic markers exist in DCIS. Candidate markers of interest will be further characterized by quantitative PCR methods, with the goal of creating a single, prognostic multiplex PCR signature that can be used on the limited clinical material typically obtained in the diagnostic phase of the evaluation of DCIS. We will then validate the assay in an independent test cohort of 100 cases of DCIS with progressive disease vs. 100 cases of DCIS that remain disease free, obtained from the population-based repository provided by the Iowa SEER residual tissue repository (RTR). We will also use an additional population-based repository located in Hawaii, to test if the prognostic signature developed from Caucasian samples can be used successfully in a different ethnic group. This will guide future work, particularly regarding the necessity of exploring the predictive power of the multiplex assay in different populations.      "

"8750650","    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this proposal is to identify key methylation marks that regulate expression of mRNAs and miRNAs involved in pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). IPF is an untreatable and often fatal lung disease that is increasing in prevalence and is likely the result of complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors such as cigarette smoke. Although it is currently believed that the injury to the alveolar epithelium initiates a cascade of events that lead to accumulation of extracellular matrix, dysregulated wound repair, and lung remodeling, dramatic changes in mRNA and miRNA expression changes and cellular phenotypes in IPF lung suggest that many different molecular processes are involved. Several lines of evidence support the role of epigenetic regulation of gene expression in IPF lung. Firstly, recent studies have demonstrated that cigarette smoke, a key environmental risk factor for IPF, has an influence on the epigenome and on methylation of specific promoters in genes involved in pathogenesis of IPF. Secondly, IPF is a genetic disease, and genetic factors influence DNA methylation. Thirdly, focused studies to date have demonstrated the influence of epigenetic marks on expression of key genes in IPF. Fourthly, data are emerging on the role of DNA methylation in regulation of miRNA expression in IPF. Finally, our recent work demonstrates extensive methylation changes on the genomic scale in IPF lung. The hypothesis of this proposal is that DNA methylation marks regulate expression of key fibrotic mRNAs and miRNAs in the IPF lung. We will test this hypothesis using existing Lung Genomics Research Consortium (LGRC), ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and Roadmap Epigenomics (RE) project data. We will first perform methyl-expression quantitative trait locus (me-eQTL) mapping to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that control mRNAs and miRNA expression as well as mRNA alternative splicing in cis and trans in IPF lung tissue. We will then prioritize the DMRs based on their regulatory potential in the lung using available ENCODE and RE methylation, histone mark, transcription factor binding, and chromatin accessibility data in lung tissue, relevant primary cells and cell lines. Results of this work will be used as preliminary data for a R01 application that will explore the influence of cigarette smoke and genetic variants on identified methylation marks and will perform functional studies to determine how treatment with agents that alter methylation marks influence expression of target mRNAs and miRNAs as well as fibro-proliferative phenotypes in vitro and in vivo.

"8708483","    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) has a long history in West Africa, but one of the less recognized parasitic infections in the region. The disease is endemic Saharan desert countries in the North, in Sahelian band from west to East Africa. Currently, there is no vaccine against the diseases. However, studies have consistently shown that sand fly saliva generally enhances infectivity of Leishmania parasites in a naive host while an adaptive immune response to whole saliva or a distinct salivary protein generally protects against both cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis in rodent models of infection. In the proposed work, 3 sites in West Africa each with distinct epidemiological and ecological environment will be compared with regard to intensity and prevalence of cutaneous leishmania infection, sand fly vector population dynamics, and disease pathogenesis with a focus on parasite and host factors and the immune response to candidate vaccines (sand fly proteins in particular). The hypothesis underlying this proposal is that a combination of parasite, vector, and human exposure to other parasitic infection such as infection with microfilariae determine the immunomodulatory effects of candidate vaccines, specifically sand fly proteins. The proposal seeks to 1] understand the basic epidemiology of cutaneous leishmaniasis and its vector in different foci of West Africa;2] understand mechanism of resistance/susceptibility to the disease;3] assess how an active infection with microfilariae alters the human immune response to sand fly salivary proteins and 4] reinforce local research capacity for future vaccine trials.        RELEVANCE: This proposal is directly relevant to public health because Leishmaniasis take an enormous toll across the globe. Its goals are to examine the epidemiology, transmission of cutaneous leishmaniasis and a component that has been largely overlooked: the immuno-modulation of sandfly proteins.            Project 1: Epidemiology of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis    Project Leader: Ousmane Faye, MD, PhD    (Description as provided by applicant): Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne disease transmitted to the host via the bite of a Leishmania infected phlebotomine sand fly. Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) has a long history in West Africa, but is one of the less recognized parasitic infections in the region. Studies have consistently shown that sand fly saliva generally enhances infectivity of Leishmania parasites in a naive host while an adaptive immune response to whole saliva or a distinct salivary protein generally protects against both cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis in rodent models of infection. In the proposed work, three sites in West Africa each with distinct epidemiological and ecological environment will be compared with regard to intensity and prevalence of cutaneous leishmania infection, sand fly vector population dynamics, and disease pathogenesis with a focus on parasite and host factors and the immune response to candidate vaccines (sand fly proteins in particular). This project seeks to 1] Determine the prevalence/incidence (of infection and disease) of CL and characterize the Leishmania parasites circulating in Malian and Ghanaian classical and cryptic foci of CL;2] Correlate specific human immune responses to sand fly salivary proteins with CL outcome. In the Aim 1 we will possibly characterize new species of Leishmania parasites from a site where the infected individuals presented with asymptomatic CL and compare it to a classical CL focus. We will also in Aim 2, for the first time, establish if sand fly salivary cellular immunity can influece the CL outcome in endemic populations.        RELEVANCE: This project is at the center of the entire proposal because it will assess the relationship between human exposure to sand fly vector bite (Project 2), the parasite and immune response to sand fly salivary proteins (Project 3) and the disease. Understanding of these relationship is important for vaccine development and field trials of control strategies.            "
"8593272","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Retinoblastoma is a malignant pediatric tumor in which mutations in the RB gene occur in the vast majority of cases. While retinoblastoma is initiated by RB inactivation, the steps between RB loss and tumorigenesis are not well understood. This proposal aims to investigate the changes that occur as retinoblastomas initiate and progress to malignancy. Mechanisms of cooperation with RB deletion in retinoblastoma may be broadly relevant for many human cancers. I hypothesize that secondary alterations help the retinoblastoma cell of origin evade a pathway to cell cycle exit controlled by the Rb family member, p130. These secondary alterations may alter the activity of p130 through control of cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) or may act at other points in the pathway (e.g. by regulating E2F transcription factors). Moreover, I hypothesize that evasion of p130-controlled cell cycle exit in RB-deficient cells may be important not only for retinoblastoma, but for other tumor types. To test these hypotheses, we will use a combination of mouse genetics, cell culture studies and investigation of primary human and murine tumor samples. These studies will use the power of mouse models to determine definitively whether candidate Rb-cooperating genes are important for tumorigenesis and to understand how these co-operating genes synergize with Rb loss. Specific Aim 1: Investigate the mechanism by which Arf functions as tumor suppressor gene in retinoblastoma. Specific Aim 2: Assess whether N-myc alters the activity of the pRB family members in promoting tumorigenesis. This work has important implications for understanding many human tumor types that exhibit RB pathway inactivation. If pathways controlled by RB family members are functionally inactivated through secondary alterations, then reactivation of such pathways may provide new opportunities for therapeutic intervention."
"8588345","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death and disability in the USA and stiffening of central arteries is now an unquestioned independent risk factor for many such diseases, including heart attack, stroke, and end-stage renal disease. The six primary determinants of the structural stiffness of arteries are elastic fiber integrity, collagen organization, smooth muscle tone, wall thickness, axial pre-stretch, and perivascular support, each of which has a molecular and cellular basis and affects system-level hemodynamics. Easily measured clinical metrics, such as pulse wave velocity, can and must play an increasingly greater role in cardiovascular risk assessment, but we must understand much better the mechanical and biological basis for changes in such metrics. For example, the relation between pulse wave velocity and arterial stiffness is often justified based on the Moens-Korteweg equation, which ignores almost all of the key determinants of wall stiffness. Our approach is unique because we will be the first to combine genetically modified mouse models and pharmacological interventions to delineate directly the effects on the material stiffness of the wall due to the integrity of elastic fibers, organization of collagen fibers, and contractility of smooth muscle. Moreover, this information will be incorporated within a novel computational tool that will allow effects of axial prestretch, perivascular support, and most importantly spatially and temporally progressive changes in large artery wall composition on hemodynamic metrics to be rigorously assessed for the first time. In particular, we suggest that large artery stiffening likely progresses from proximal to distal large arteries and identification of the early onset of such changes (e.g., prior to marked changes in pulse wave velocity) may allow earlier diagnosis and thus more effective intervention, prior to the propagation of detrimental effects of large artery stiffening to distal muscular arteries and eventually the microvessels, changes to which may be more difficult to reverse pharmacologically. Hence, we seek to deepen our fundamental understanding of the basis of arterial stiffening and to enable better clinical assessments and treatment planning based on readily available data. Specifically, we hypothesize that central arteries stiffen due, in large part, to a cyclic-strain induced damage to or degradation of elastic fibers that likely progresses over time from proximal to distal arteries because of initial spatial distributions of elastin and associated wall strains. To test this hypothesis, we will quantify and compare for the first time progressive changes in wall mechanics, composition, and hemodynamics in 3 basic mouse models (wild-type, fibrillin-1 deficient, and fibulin-5 null), each subjected to 3 pharmacological inter- ventions (L-NAME, doxycycline, and BAPN). That is, we will use genetically modified mouse models of graded decreases in elastic fiber integrity, not initially diminished elastin, for this will allow progressive changes to be quantified independent of possible compensatory adaptations that occur during development in elastin deficient mice. We expect loss of nitric oxide (L-NAME group) to highlight a role of smooth muscle tone and exacerbate the progression of wall stiffening, diminished proteinase activity (doxycycline) to separate roles of mechanical damage and chemical degradation of elastin while attenuating wall stiffening, and inhibiting collagen cross-linking (BAPN) to separate the coupled effects of elastin on the stiffness of extant collagen from the role of new collagen deposition. The experimental data will be used to construct, verify, and validate a novel fluid-solid-interaction model that can reveal precisely the effects of individual determinants of wall stiffening on system-level hemodynamics. Once accomplished for the mouse, parametric studies will be performed on 3 prototypical models of hemodynamics in humans (young, middle-aged, and old) to reveal, for the first time, the effects of progressive wall stiffening on clinical metrics of hemodynamics such as pulse wave velocity, pulse pressure, and pulse pressure waveform. We submit that modeling studies alone can delineate effects of spatially and temporally progressive increases in arterial stiffening on system-level hemodynamics, with the potential to identify improved indicators of early stiffening that may allow an earlier clinical intervention that can prevent the longer-term irreversible changes to the microstructure that otherwise inevitably occur.

"8643218","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to discover genes underlying taste preferences, particularly those responsible for the preferences for sodium, calcium, and acids. Over the last 15 yr, several fundamental insights into the genetic and molecular basis of taste transduction have been made using mouse models but there are disadvantages to using mice, and many questions remain. The rat has the potential to be a better model. It has traditionally been used for taste preference experiments, and there is a massive literature dealing with rat physiology, nutrition and learning mechanisms. The problem has been that until recently genetic tools for studying the rat have not been available, but this has changed. This project will take advantage of a new consomic rat resource to investigate the genetic basis of taste preferences in rats. Preliminary work has identified consomic rat strains that differ from their background strain in preferences for sodium, calcium and acids. To exploit this, we now propose to better characterize the phenotype of the consomic rat strains, and isolate the genes involved by breeding congenic rat lines. The expression patterns of genes in the congenic interval will be surveyed to evaluate their potential contribution to the phenotype. These studies will lead to the discovery and characterization of genes responsible for taste preferences.      "
"8664454","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease where the causes of the disease are unknown for ~90% of cases. However, a variety of genetic mutations cause PD in ~10% cases. Among the genetic causes of PD, autosomal dominant forms of familial PD (FPD) share many of the pathological and clinical features with more common late onset sporadic PD. Recently, mutations in LRRK2 gene were shown to cause late-onset FPD with variable penetrance and a-synuclein (a-Syn) pathology (a-synucleinopathy). Thus, PD caused by LRRK2 may involve interactions with environmental and genetic factors. To understand the pathogenic involvement of LRRK2 in causing PD with a-synucleinopathy, we have generated conditional human LRRK2 (hLRRK2) transgenic (Tg) mouse model where high-levels of mutant (R1441C and G2019S) and wild type (WT) hLRRK2 expression can be achieved in subcortical regions. We will determine that when expressed in subcortical neurons, mutant hLRRK2 causes progressive neuropathology in mice, including the loss of dopaminergic neurons. Because only ~50% of mutant hLRRK2 carriers develop PD within 70 years of age, mutant hLRRK2 may combine with other factors to fully express the pathogenic potential. We will test this hypothesis by testing whether mutant hLRRK2 increases vulnerability in dopaminergic neurons to dopaminergic toxin. Further, we will determine whether there is a pathologic interaction between mutant hLRRK2 and a-Syn in causing neurodegeneration of PD relevant neuronal populations.        "

"8669117","Despite significant advances in pig-to-primate organ xenotransplantation, long-term graft survival is currently limited by the development of a thrombotic microangiopathy and platelet sequestration in the grafted organ and/or a consumptive coagulopathy in the recipient. The present proposal tests homogeneous heparin sulfates (HSs) synthesized using computational modeling and enzymatic/chemical tools as outlined in Projects I (PL-I. Dr. Balagurunathan) and II (Pl-ll. Dr. Desai). We hypothesize that chemically-synthesized HSs designed to preferentially inhibit Factor Xa (FXa) and/or thrombin will ameliorate the thrombotic microangiopathy and/or consumptive coagulopathy seen in the context of pig-to-primate xenografts by inhibiting thrombin formation and platelet activation. In addition, HSs optimized to bind chemokines (from Project III) may act as chemokine decoy factors to prevent cell sequestration synergistically with anticoagulation. These HSs will be evaluated in the context of various xenotransplantation models using cells and organs from pigs genetically modified to protect against antibody/complement-mediated, inflammatory, and coagulation rejection mechanisms. These HS-based therapies will be tested by. - (i) in vitro assays to determine the best HS candidate drugs for further studies, (ii) ex vivo pig lung hemoperfusion using human blood, (iii) pig artery Tx in baboons, and (iv) pig kidney Tx in baboons. Model (ii) constitutes a short-duration model (with graft function measured in hours) allowing rapid screening of the HSs being tested, whereas models (iii) and (iv) constitute longer-duration models (days or weeks). Furthermore, the effect of the HS will be monitored (iii) in a low-antigen load model without immunosuppressive therapy, or (iv) in a high-antigen load model in which graft recipients will receive immunosuppressive therapy aimed at inhibiting the adaptive T cell response. The prime aim of the study is to identify one (or more) HS that is more specific and more efficient at inhibiting the development of thrombotic microangiopathy and consumptive coagulopathy than is the current clinically-used heparin, and that, furthermore, is not associated with the side-effects of heparin, e.g., bleeding, that limit the dosage that can be administered. The second aim is to investigate the synergy between the HS identified as being optimal with the genetic manipulations in the organ-source pig, e.g., expression of human thrombomodulin directed towards inhibiting thrombotic microangiopathy and consumptive coagulopathy. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The transplantation of organs from genetically-engineered pigs would provide an alternative source to human organs for clinical transplantation, but is currently complicated by coagulation disturbances that can be fatal. The administration of specific synthetic heparan sulfates that will be designed and investigated in this proposal are likely to prevent these coagulation disturbances, thus enabling xenotransplantation to advance to clinical trials."
"8689019","The developmental origins hypothesis relates early exposures to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) to  the development of chronic diseases, including metabolic syndrome, a condition affecting up to 25% of US  adults and 30% of obese adolescents. Limited research in humans has considered the mechanisms by  which exposures to EDCs mixtures interact with diet to alter maternal and child metabolic homeostasis, nor  considered whether subsequent exposures during adolescence exacerbate risk of metabolic syndrome.  Pilot human and animal data from our Formative CEHC: 'Perinatal exposures, epigenetics, child obesity and  sexual maturation"" (P20 ESDI 8171/ RD834800, Pl: Peterson) suggest that the disruptive effects of  representative maternal EDCs on metabolic and epigenetic markers may differ across sensitive periods of  child development. Drawing on unparalleled institutional resources including the UM NIEHS Center of  Excellence Epigenetics Laboratory (P30 ES017885) and the Michigan Nutrition and Obesity Research  Center (MNORC, P30 DK089503), this project will test the hypothesis that EDC mixtures (BPA, phthalates,  lead, cadmium) via epigenetic mechanisms induce oxidative stress (tyrosine oxidation products), disrupt  metabolic homeostasis (free fatty acids, amino acids, Acyl-carnitine) and lead to changes in gene  transcription and metabolic function. We further hypothesize that dietary macro- and micronutrient intake  and dietary patterns during pregnancy and adolescence will modify the impact of EDC mixtures on these  outcomes. Study participants include the Michigan Mother-Infant Pairs (MMIP) cohort (n=80) (extension of  R01 ES017005, PI: Padmanabhan) and 400 children followed from pregnancy to 8-15 years of age through  our 18-yr Early Life Exposures in Mexico to ENvironmental Toxicants (ELEMENT) collaboration with  Mexico's Instituto Nacional de Salud Publica (INSP). Findings will: 1) provide proof of concept that EDC  mixtures perturb metabolic homeostasis, 2) clarify the role of diet in amplifying or negating such effects, 3)  illustrate the epigenetic and transcriptional changes involved and 4) inform the design of future interventions  to modify metabolic consequences of EDC exposures both in utero and during the pubertal transition."
"8640182","    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  DNA EXCISION REPAIR AND DNA DAMAGE CHECKPOINTS  Nucleotide excision repair and DNA damage checkpoints are two major cellular responses to DNA damage that are essential for genomic stability. The goal of our research is to understand the molecular mechanisms of these systems and to use this information to develop cancer prevention and treatment strategies. To accomplish this goal we will perform the following experiments. Aim 1. Nucleotide Excision Repair and Skin Cancer Development as a Function of the Circadian Clock.  Our studies on the regulation of nucleotide excision repair in mammals have revealed that excision repair exhibits high amplitude oscillation with a daily periodicity in most mouse tissues. We will analyze the daily variability of excision repair of UV photoproducts in skin and determine whether this variability is associated with carcinogenicity of UV light delivered at different times of the day. The results of this study will enable us to make specific recommendations to lower the incidence of skin cancer induced by sunlight and other UV sources. Aim 2. Biochemical Analysis of the UV-Induced DNA Damage Checkpoint.  We will purify and characterize the proteins involved in ATR kinase-mediated DNA damage checkpoint response which is the primary checkpoint pathway activated by UV and UV-mimetic chemical agents. We will reconstitute this checkpoint system from highly purified components in vitro and analyze the coupling of nucleotide excision repair with the ATR checkpoint signaling pathway. Understanding this DNA damage signaling pathway should facilitate the design of novel chemotherapeutic approaches to treat cancer.        "
"8600985"," 7. PROJECT SUMMARY Myocardial infarction resulting from ischemic injury is a prominent and common feature of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Cardiac myosin binding protein-C (cMyBP-C) is, by its degradation during proteolysis, an important determinant of myocardial contractile pathogenesis during I-R injury. Briefly, cMyBP-C is a thick filament-associated protein that stabilizes myosin, an important component of the contractile machinery, to regulate sarcomeric structure and function in the heart. Mutations in the cMyBP-C gene account for ~34% of all cardiomyopathy cases, 70% of which are predicted to produce unstable truncated proteins. During I-R injury, we demonstrated that extensive fragmentation of cMyBP-C correlates with altered sarcomeric structure and contractile dysfunction. Therefore, while the short-term goal is to elucidate the proteolytic and pathogenic properties of cMyBP-C in the clinical context of cardioprotection during ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) injury, the long-term goal is to determine the mechanisms by which cMyBP-C stabilizes sarcomeric structure and function in order to confer cardioprotection during I-R injury. More specifically, our preliminary studies show that calpains degrade cMyBP-C into several fragments and that the 29-kDa fragment is the predominant fragment in vitro. Such proteolysis leads to the release of the 29-kDa fragment into the blood stream during I-R injury in mice. Moreover, mass spectrometry analyses confirm that the release of the 29-kDa fragment is associated with the calpain-targeted site (CTS), which is a conserved phosphorylation motif that possibly regulates its cleavage. From a therapeutic perspective, these findings indicate that the ablation of the CTS could result in resistance to calpain-mediated proteolysis, thus abrogating release of the 29-kDa fragment. Therefore, we propose that inhibition of CTS cleavage would secure the structural integrity of cMyBP-C, thus preserving contractile structure and function. However, the clinical and pathogenic significance of cMyBP-C degradation, as well as the properties of its proteolysis, have not been determined and therefore represent a clinically important area of translational research. The goal, therefore, is to determine the correlation between the release of the 29- kDa fragment in the blood and contractile dysfunction, demonstrate its toxic effects in cardiomyocytes and examine how the inhibition of CTS cleavage in cMyBP-C protects the heart from I-R injury. Overall, the proposed research aims to define the stability and function of cMyBP-C in the context of supportive therapy during I-R injury, in general, and heart muscle contractility, specifically. To achieve our goals, Specific Aim 1 will determine the levels of 29-kDa fragment in the blood, according to infarct size and contractile function during I-R injury. Specific Aim 2 will determine the pathogenic properties of the 29-kDa fragment in the context of myosin function. Specific Aim 3 will determine whether site-specific inhibition of the CTS, as defined above, can preserve cMyBP-C stability and function during I-R injury and thus confer cardioprotection. Importantly, once the kinetics of the 29-kDa fragment have validated that this peptide is quantifiable in the serum of wild-type non-transgenic mice with induced I-R injury, we can confirm its potential as a clinically useful readout of post-ischemic myocardial infarction. Our experimental approach is comprehensive, ranging from the analysis of molecular interactions to functional assessments of sarcomeric arrangement and function, both in vitro and in vivo. I-R injury will be induced in wild-type non-transgenic mice to define the sequential release of the 29-kDa fragment and its blood serum levels in relation to infarct size, calpain activities, and myocardial function, compared with controls. Adult mouse cardiomyocytes have been chosen as the model system to investigate the pathogenic properties of the 29-kDa fragment by using recombinant adenoviruses and peptides. To determine the association between the CTS in cMyBP-C and cardioprotection, we will use transgenic mice expressing cMyBP-C in which the CTS has been ablated and bred into the cMyBP-C null background, compared with transgenic mice expressing phospho-mimetic and wild-type cMyBP-C controls. Endpoint measurements include the amount of the 29-kDa fragment in the blood correlated with infarct area and cardiac function, calpain activity, cMyBP-C phosphorylation levels, intracellular Ca2+ transients, Mg2+-ATPase activity, myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity, molecular binding studies, sarcomere structure and function."
"8626247","    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The capacity of the ventricles to perform work (i.e., power) is essential for moving blood throughout the circulatory system. Ventricular/myocyte power is determined ultimately by three myofibrillar properties;(i) the amount of force developed, (ii) the rate of force development, and (iii) the rate that myocardium shortens against loads. However, the sub-cellular processes that determine these properties are incompletely understood. The overall purpose of this study is to determine the sub-cellular factors that regulate myocyte power generating capacity. The specific objectives of the proposed studies are designed to determine (1) if PKA-mediated phosphorylation of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) is both necessary and sufficient to dictate sarcomere length dependence of force generation in cardiac myocytes, (2) how titin, MyBP-C, and myosin cross-bridges interact to modulate sarcomere length dependence of power output, and (3) to determine the time-course of changes in sarcomere length dependence of force, rates of force development, loaded shortening, and power output during the progression of heart failure. A rodent model of heart failure will be used to test the hypothesis that myocytes in compensated hearts exhibit greater sarcomere length dependence of force and power output due to a combination of greater expression of the larger N2BA titin isoform and greater PKA- induced myofibrillar protein phosphorylation, but with progression to ventricular failure sarcomere length dependence of force and power is markedly reduced due to reduced PKA- mediated phosphorylation of titin, MyBP-C, and cTnI. These studies are highly significant in their potential to determine the basis for the control of power-generating capacity in healthy myocytes and how these processes are altered with the progression of heart failure.

"8620654","    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In cancer patients, determination of whether a malignancy has spread is the single most important factor used to develop a therapeutic plan and to predict prognosis. In most cases, cancer cells initially spread through regional lymph nodes. Therefore, clinical evaluation for the presence of regional lymph node metastases is of paramount importance. Unfortunately, there are no real-time, non-invasive clinical methods that can reliably detect and diagnose micrometastases in lymph nodes. Therefore, there is an urgent clinical need for an imaging technique that is widely available, is non-invasive and simple to perform, is safe, and can reliably detect and adequately diagnose lymph node micrometastases in real time.  The overall goal of our research program is to develop an advanced, in-vivo, noninvasive, molecular specific imaging technology, i.e., integrated ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging combined with targeted plasmonic nanosensors, capable of immediate and accurate assessment of sentinel lymph node micrometastases in real time. The underlying hypothesis of this project is that photoacoustic imaging integrated with widely used clinical ultrasound imaging is possible and both ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging can be performed in real time, yielding an immediate diagnosis and allowing early implementation of treatment.  A wide range of scientific and engineering, biomedical and clinical problems must be addressed to fully explore the capabilities of molecular specific ultrasound and photoacoustic lymphatic (MS-USPAL) imaging in detection and characterization of sentinel lymph node micrometastases. The current application is focused on important aspects of clinical translation of MS-USPAL imaging. We will develop and validate clinically translatable plasmonic nanosensors for MS-USPAL. We will use ultra-small gold nanoparticles to target epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is overexpressed in squamous carcinoma and in many other epithelial neoplasms. For highly sensitive detection of cancer cells, we will explore EGF receptor mediated endocytosis and the effect of plasmon resonance coupling between closely spaced molecular specific nanoparticles. The ultra-small size of nanoparticles will be highly favorable for rapid clearance from the body which will allow safe transition into clinical practice Additionally, 5 nm ligand capped gold nanoparticles will greatly reduce nonspecific interactions and reduce the uptake of nanoparticles by immune cells such as macrophages present due to lymph node inflammation, thus diminishing false positive results. Furthermore, we will design and construct a prototype of the clinical MS-USPAL imaging system capable of imaging 5 nm nanoparticles in-vivo.         "
"8646949","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The selectins are adhesion molecules belonging to the C-type lectin family. They are expressed constitutively on the surface of blood leukocytes and on activated endothelial cells and platelets. The selectins prominently bind O-linked glycans that are bound to Ser/Thr residues on a variety of glycoprotein scaffolds. Such binding between selectins and O-glycans initiate a series of steps that eventually results in the adhesion of leukocytes to blood vessel walls at sites of inflammation. This biomolecular interaction also conditions normal immune response, and it plays an important role in certain types of cardiovascular disorders and cancer metastatic processes. It is widely believed that controlling the rate of leukocyte adhesion by antagonizing selectin-ligand interactions can lead to new therapies to combat a variety of vascular ailments. Thus, in this proposal, we develop metabolic strategies to control leukocyte-endothelial interactions by engineering the glycans that are expressed on natural selectin-ligands. The specific aims are: Aim 1: To evaluate the feasibility of using monosaccharide analogs to alter glycan structures and leukocyte cell adhesion properties. Here, we test the possibility that analogs of the naturally occurring monosaccharide, GalNAc and also Fucose, can be fed to cells in order to modify either the core or terminal structures of glycans that function as the natural ligands for the selectins. We evaluate the ability and mechanism by which these chemical inhibitors permeate cells, engage and modify glycan biosynthetic pathways, and inhibit cell adhesion. Aim 2: To define the precise 1(2,3) sialyltransferase(s) regulating leukocyte adhesion to L-, E- and P-selectin in humans. Here, we either over- express specific sialyltransferases belonging to the ST3Gal family in leukocytes, or stably silence one or more ST3Gals at the same time in these cells. The effect of this ""system perturbation"" on selectin-ligand glycan structure and leukocyte cell adhesion function under fluid shear is evaluated. Aim 3: To determine the role for reversible sialylation in regulating leukocyte selectin-ligand structure. Here, we quantify the extent to which human ST3Gals catalyze readily reversible reactions, a property called 'reversible sialylation'. We then evaluate if 'reversible sialylation'plays an important role during the biosynthesis of selectin-ligands. Success in this aim will demonstrate that besides enzymatic rate constants that drive glycoconjugate synthesis in living cells, equilibrium processes governed by reversible enzymatic activity may also control glycan biosynthesis. Diverse experimental methods are applied to accomplish the above aims. These include cell adhesion studies under controlled flow conditions, in vivo experiments in a mouse model of inflammation, and lentiviral strategies to silence or overexpress specific genes in human leukocytes and hematopoietic progenitor/stem cells. In the long run, we anticipate that novel strategies to antagonize selectin-ligand binding interactions will be identified from this work that may aid future drug design.      "
"8685872","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A number of bacterial natural products contain substituted ???-unsaturated-?-lactones. The chemical nature of the substituents alters the biological activity considerably. For natural products such as fostriecin and phoslactomycins (PLMs), the ?-substituent is a linear polyketide chain and unusual in that it has multiple cis double bonds and a phosphate group. The PLMs exhibit remarkably selectivity and potent activity against human fungal pathogens, including Aspergillus fumigatus. The DNA encoding the PLM and fostriecin biosynthetic processes have been cloned, sequenced and analyzed. It has been shown that both natural products are generated by modular polyketide synthases (PKSs). In the case of PLM much of the biosynthetic process has been deciphered. The knowledge and genetic tools provided through ongoing PLM biosynthetic studies has allowed the generation of blocked mutants, hybrid pathways, and mutasynthetic approaches to access new natural products based around the PLM skeleton. These compounds are generally obtained in excellent fermentation yield (10-50 mg/L) from fermentations and include significant structural diversity both around the lactone core and in the delta substituent. Additional structural variation has been obtained by chemical and efficient enzymatic modification of these new PLM core structures. The proposal has 4 aims. Aim 1 will test a hypothesis for how modules in both systems establish the unusual cis double bonds in the ?-substituent. Aim 2-3 will test a hypothesis that the cis double bond of the unsaturated lactone, is not established by a canonical dehydration domain within a PKS module, but rather an unprecedented decarboxylative elimination from a malonylated pathway intermediate. A series of chemical, biochemical, genetic and structural approaches will investigate the enzyme-catalyzed elimination reaction, determine how the malonylated intermediate is generated, and the sequence of these steps in the PLM biosynthetic pathway. Aims 4 will focus on evaluating the antifungal activity of new PLMs, and the basis for their selective antifungal activity.      "

Projects 1, 2, 3 and 6 specifically aim to develop advanced techniques for the detection, assessment, and evaluation of the effect of hazardous substances on human health and improve methods to assess the risks to human health presented by benzene, arsenic, trichloroethylene and other hazardous substances. Project 5 will use nanotechnology to develop methods to detect hazardous substances in the environment in a simple, inexpensive fashion. Projects 4 and 6 will develop biological, chemical, and physical methods to remediate waste sites and reduce the amount and toxicity of hazardous substances. A Genomics and Analytical Chemistry core (C) and a Quantitative Biology core (D) will assist project researchers in meeting their goals. A Research Translation core (B) will facilitate intensive discussions between investigators and government audiences, and generate new initiatives to increase understanding of the significance and applicability of research to public health protection. The overall goal is to enhance understanding of the relationship between exposure and disease;provide usable tools to improve human health risk assessments;and, develop a range of prevention and remediation strategies to improve and protect public health and the environment. The program will be overseen and coordinated by an Administration core (A)."
"8634129","Project I - Zhang &Chen Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Lipton, Stuart A.  PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  The N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of gluatmate receptor (NMDAR) is essential for normal function of the central nervous system (CNS). However, excessive activation of NMDARs, particulariy of extrasynaptic as opposed to synaptic receptors, mediates, at least in part, neuronal or synaptic damage in many neurological disorders, such as hypoxic-ischemic brain injury and, as recently suggested, in Down syndrome. Blockade of excessive NMDAR activity must be achieved without interference with its normal brain function. We have taken two approaches for clinically-tolerated pharmacological and genetic intervention on NMDARs. One approach is to use Memantine but also NO species to further down regulate the NMDAR by S-nitrosylation.  The structural determinants on NMDARs for the action of Memantine and NO-like species will be characterized further under the auspices of this grant. Another approach is to utilize the inhibitory effect of a novel family of NMDAR subunits, composed of NRSA and NRSB, to downregulate NMDARs by affecting channel permeability, in a sense mimicking the effect of the NMDAR antagonist drugs that are also being developed here. We will study the role of the MS domain of NRS subunits that downregulate activity of NMDARs and also design NRS ligand-binding domain (LBD)-based screening assays to discover new compounds that modulate NRS-containing receptors. These agents will be useful for characterizing NRS-containing receptors, and possibly for neuroprotection.  Accordingly, the Specific Aims of this proposal are as follows: 1) To study the effect of S-nitrosylation/redox modulation of the loose linker region between the amino-terminal domain (ATD) and the LBD of NMDARs by electrophysiology;2) To develop LBD-derived screening assays to screen for ligands selective for the NRS subunit of the NMDAR. These ligands will be further characterized and refined by secondary assays, chemical modification, and co-crystallization;3) To study the inhibitory effect of peptides derived from the out vestibule (MS) region of NRS subunits on NMDAR permeability."
"8927816","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA functions as the central conduit for information transfer in biology - in simple replicating entities like RNA viruses and in complex multi-cellular organisms. RNA is uniquely able to play this role because it encodes information at two levels: in its linear primary sequence and in its ability to form functionally critical higher-order folds. Work to date, largely focused on intensive study of a few specific regulatory motifs, has revealed that RNA secondary and tertiary structures regulate splicing, translation and protein folding, binding by small ligands and drugs and proteins, and collapse into large-scale structural domains. There are only a small number of examples in which genome-scale RNA structures have been characterized. However, numerous new biological insights were uncovered in each case. RNA viruses are especially informative systems because their compact genomes feature a dense array of functionally important secondary and tertiary structure elements. Moreover, every identification of a new regulatory motif in a pathogenic virus presents a unique target for anti-virus therapeutic design. Guided by several years of preliminary and exploratory studies, we are poised to make very high- throughput and high-content RNA secondary and tertiary structure analysis straightforward. We will apply newly invented massively parallel secondary and tertiary structure constraint-generation technologies coupled with novel molecular dynamics-driven structural refinement to understand the biological roles of higher-order structure in the hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA genome. Our Specific Aims are designed to reveal numerous new roles for RNA structure in the replication cycle of HCV, to do so in a way likely to inform many fields of biology, to make possible new therapeutic strategies for inhibiting viral replication, and to create tools that can be widely adopted by non-expert laboratories for analysis of complex, biologically authentic RNAs. Aim 1: Analyze the structure of three representative HCV RNA genomes using SHAPE, detected by massively parallel sequencing, to identify conserved base pairing and tertiary structure motifs. Aim 2: Create and validate an accurate and scalable approach for using experimental base pairing and through-space tertiary constraints to drive three-dimensional fold refinement for large RNAs. Aim 3: Integrate the technologies developed in this work to refine three-dimensional structure models and to discover new regulatory motifs for plus-sense HCV RNA genomes."
"8693935","The goal of the Cancer Disparities Program (CD) is to foster and sustain an integrated transdisciplinary environment for dedicated multi-level and multi-ethnic cancer disparities research that studies mechanisms and interventions from prevention through survivorship. The Program research emphasizes disparities affecting the region's largest ethnic populations, Latinos and Asians, engages intensively with the African American community, and includes other groups that are affected by disparities such as those who have limited English proficiency. Based on a shared understanding of the multi-level nature of these disparities and the interventions to reverse their course, the Program themes are: (A) Biologic determinants of cancer disparities;(B) Individual behavioral/psychological factors, emphasizing culture, language, and social context;and (C) healthcare and other systems factors, including interventions for systems change to reduce cancer disparities. CD is led by Dr. Rena Pasick, whose career has been dedicated to conducting social and behavioral research in cancer disparities among multi-ethnic populations, and to training a diverse cadre of cancer disparities population scientists;and Dr. Tung Nguyen, a clinician researcher with scientific expertise in Asian American cancer disparities and community-based participatory research. The Program has 24 members who have published 399 peer-reviewed papers in the past five years;15% were intra- and 16% were inter-programmatic publications. Annual extramural funding (total costs, 2010) is $10,476,370 in peer-reviewed support, nearly double the amount at the last review;total non-peer reviewed support is $1,631,255.    The Program also adds value to the Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center (Center) by bringing expertise in diverse populations to clinical programs;by connecting community members and clinicians;by fostering the intra-programmatic and inter-programmatic collaborations that advance knowledge in cancer disparities;and by conducting significant and successful training programs to increase the number of researchers who are under-represented minorities. Future directions include expansion of the Program via new and continuing multi-component grants, addition of members through recruitment and advancement of junior faculty, increased collaboration with clinical programs, and development of a multi-cultural communication shared resource."
"8681557","    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the U.S. and the third leading cause of mortality world-wide. The most common form, ischemic stoke, is caused by blood clots occluding arterial supply, resulting in permanent neurological damage or death. For a minority of patients, blood clots can be removed or lysed to prevent or limit stroke injury. However, neuroprotectants that improve survival and recovery are not available. Following arterial occlusion, neuronal death spreads outward from the initial infarct as neurons depolarize causing massive glutamate release and hyperactivation of NMDA receptors (NMDAR). As a result, excitotoxic Ca2+ flows into cells where it activates the protease calpain. This excitotoxic cascade is a major component of stroke pathophysiology. However, efforts to block the cascade with NMDAR antagonists have not proven effective in clinical trials due to unwanted effects. We discovered that the protein kinase Cdk5 physically links calpain to the NR2B subunit of NMDARs. Cdk5 is also bound to its activator p35. Through this NR2B-calpain- Cdk5/p35 signaling complex, excitotoxic activation of NMDARs causes calpain to convert p35 to p25. Cdk5 associated with p25 causes neuronal death and has been suggested to mediate to ischemic injury. However little is yet known of how Cdk5 or p35/p25 contributes to stroke pathophysiology or how it may be effectively targeted to improve outcome. Here we propose to characterize the dysregulation of Cdk5 following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and determine the neuroprotective effects of loss of Cdk5 or p35 in mice. As a novel strategy to achieve neuroprotection we will target the NR2B-calpain-Cdk5/p35 cascade by identifying functional protein-protein interaction motifs and developing small interfering peptides (SIPs) that prevent calpain-Cdk5 and NR2B-Cdk5 interactions. These SIPs will be optimized as molecules that potently and specifically dissociate the NR2B-calpain-Cdk5/p35 and prevent Cdk5/p25 generation by NMDAR hyperactivation without otherwise affecting the functions of the receptors, calpain, or Cdk5. We will then assess their ability to neuroprotect and improve behavioral and histological outcome in mice subjected to MCAO. These translational studies will advance our knowledge of the mechanisms that mediate stroke injury and derive novel neuroprotectants that will potentially lead to the development of therapies that improving recovery and reduce stroke-related disability.

"8762880","    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is for Dr. Sanjay Basu, a physician-epidemiologist establishing himself in the field of statistical and modeling research on cardiovascular disease disparities. This award will allow Dr. Basu to: (1) develop a career focus in nutritional epidemiology and cardiovascular disease disparities;(2) learn how to implement ""systems science"" mathematical modeling methods that simulate the impact of cardiovascular disease interventions;and (3) gain the necessary content expertise to address major unanswered questions in the epidemiology of cardiovascular disease disparities. To achieve these goals, Dr. Basu has assembled a mentoring team with expertise on nutrition and its relationship to cardiovascular disease risk;the epidemiology of cardiovascular disease disparities;and mathematical modeling. Dr. Basu's research proposal addresses disparities in the prevalence of hypertension between groups of different socioeconomic status (SES). The Institute of Medicine (IOM) has declared lower sodium consumption to be a national goal to reduce hypertension-related cardiovascular disease.2 Dr. Basu's research will test hypotheses about the relationship between social factors and sodium consumption among low-SES populations experiencing the highest prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension.3 In Aim 1, a regression tree analysis4 applied to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey will test the hypothesis that variations in sodium consumption within the population can be predicted using a few key sociodemographic variables.5 The analysis will identify what social factors can best explain heterogeneities in sodium intake within the US population. In Aim 2, we will then test the hypothesis that an economic program incentivizing low-SES populations to increase the number of times per month they go grocery shopping can lead high-sodium consumers to substitute packaged products with fresh produce, thereby lowering their sodium consumption.6-8 To better assess causality, we will analyze a unique ""quasi-natural experiment"" in Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania in which a subset of households on food stamps were randomly allocated to receive benefits twice monthly instead of once monthly, which induced more frequent grocery shopping despite having the same overall monthly grocery budget as matched controls. The results of Aims 1 and 2 will be incorporated into a simulation model of hypertension in Aim 3. An agent-based model will be constructed to compare the impact of the program in Aim 2 to two other programs- front-of-package nutrition labeling9 and a vegetable voucher plan10-that attempt to influence consumers to reduce sodium consumption. The model will estimate the impact and cost-effectiveness of the interventions for reducing national hypertension disparities. This will form the basis of an R01 application to study novel sodium reduction strategies that target consumer food choice behaviors. This proposal addresses NHLBI strategic plan challenge 3.1, which encourages social science research incorporating ""systems science"" modeling methods to investigate social factors and policy interventions to reduce health disparities.11        "
